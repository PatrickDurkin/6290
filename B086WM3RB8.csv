Reviewed in India on 20 February 2020,Hansel Pereira,Amazing product !!,"Its a really good pair of Airdopes. Good bass. Just at the low volume its a bit too soft need to keep the volume on 65 percent onwards to get a really good feel. Distance from the phone pretty much 10 or 15 meter later it get a bit faded. Looks too good permium quality the led lights on the CTC ( capacitive touch control ) . The fit is too good if any problems you feel its a bit loose change the ear tips. It fits really well in helmets but an advice do not use both together while riding a bike you literally can't hear much . The CTC button is too sensitive but need to get used to it.The colour variant is too catchy really nice. I was expecting a big charging case but when I saw it was so small like literally fits ino your palm. It has magenetic charging so your airdope dont fall off and the lid is magnetic so it wont open unecssarily. Its has a C type charging port thats one great thing done by boAt since most of the phones have C type charging port you wont have to search for a charger. I just got it today still need to play around with it will update in a while .

Reviewed in India on 2 March 2020,Vyshnavi Mudumby,Best buds in the budget with Type C,"I have been researching about getting a nice TWS buds for my everyday use.. My priorities were like this -. 1. Balanced Sound with a nice blend of Bass, Treble and Mids.(I'm an audiophile but was ready to compromise cuz budget :P). 2. Type C Charging - I use a Oneplus 6T so it is much convenient to manage things with one charger.. 3. Decent battery backup.. 4. Shoudn't feel bulky in the ears.. And then I got these buds, and here goes my feedback -. 1. First Impression - They look great, love the red and black color tone.. 2. Fits well in the ears without feeling bulky.. 3. Not super satisfied with the audio quality, felt it was too Bass heavy(Found a fix with Equaliser settings).. 4. There's no volume control option from the buds, but you can do it from your phone without much effort(Ain't it?).. Fix to adjust bass if you're on a Oneplus Device -. 1. Fortunately Oneplus provides Audio Tuner to adjust EQ at OS level.. 2. Open the Audio Tuner and go to Sound Enhancement.. 3. Select Feat. JBL E1+. 4. Open Preset options. 5. Select Blues and Voila!! 🎯. For other phones -. I'm not sure about other devices as I haven't tested on them, but here are a couple of things I used to do on my previous phones to adjust sound settings. As most phones or music player apps provide equaliser settings, you can select presets like 'Vocal/Jazz/Blues/Pop' which tend to compress Bass and enhance Mids and Treble.. Also, after reading a couple of reviews of other TWS buds, I considered changing the ear tips to smaller ones and surprisingly it boosted the experience. However, it mostly depends on the size of your ears so might not work for everyone.. Do let me know if you need any further information about this, happy to help! 🙂.

Reviewed in India on 30 June 2020,Bhanu Bachchan,Too much price for these not poor pair of Earbuds.,"Boat is an Indian Company but all the products of this company are Made in China so it is not making the products itself. They are just buying Chinese products and selling it by their name.. I have extensively used these buds for a month while doing workout and watching movies and listening music and below is my detailed review of the Earbuds.. Pros:. 1. Great Sound Quality. 2. Great Bass. 3. Great Battery Life. 4. Fast Charging. Cons:. 1. It doesn't fit properly in ears. It is just not me, 3 more friends of mine are facing the same issue. It doesn't fit properly specially in the right ear. Also, your right ear starts paining after sometime if you push it or try to fit it properly by rotating it in your ear.. 2. So, if the right bud doesn't fit properly so obviously you don't feel good sound quality from your right ear bud. Sometimes I felt that their is some problem with the Right earbud sound quality but then I realised that it is because of the fitting issue.. 3. Earbuds slips out of your ear when you wear it while working out due to sweat. It gets slipped when it gets wet due to sweat. Even when the earbuds are fitted properly they will fall out when they get wet.. 4. The company says that as soon as you open the charging box of the buds both buds gets paired between each other automatically but sometimes both doesn't gets paired between each other and only left or the right one gets paired to the phone or the laptop. Then you have to wait for sometime for the other to get paired.. 5. The range of the Bluetooth is not that great. Sometimes even you are in the range or at the boundary level within the range one of the buds will stop working and you will hear sound from only one bud. Most of the times it is Right.. 6. Sometimes one of the earbud stops working without any reason and the battery status of both the buds are different which is very weird.. 7. My right Earbud stopped working after a month. So I have to find a Service Centre which are not everywhere and not very good.. 8. Last but certainly not the least, their after sales service is horrible. Their customer care doesn't respond to calls, emails, Twitter or anything. It is a pain to reach out to them. They behave like a roadside local shop.. So all in all it is a good pair of earbuds but Rs.2500/- is too much for these earbuds. So I would not suggest to buy this pair of Earbuds at this price.. You can buy Noise Shots or Noise Shots XO and those are much better and you will enjoy the experience with them.. boAt is Horrible and ridiculous.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 9 August 2020,Ajay Nair,Really Good product,"* It's my first ever truly wireless buds and the sound quality is very good. Bass quality is awesome.. * Earbuds are really light in weight and easy to fit due to its ergonomic design and never falls off the ears.. Though the case is bit on the heavier side but it's totally understandable as it carries 2600mAh battery.. Rgb lighting and touch is very responsive. * The instant wake n pair tech is really good within 2 secs of opening the case buds gets connected to the previously paired device.. * I tried playing pubg and I didn't notice any latency , it was really fine.. * While calling indoors the voice reaching is clear and crisp but as it has no noise cancellation for mic in outdoor condition or noisy environment will not be that good but still I'll say above avg performance.. **** Battery🔋 review (after 2 weeks). Battery life is exactly what they have promised and I guess I got even more than that.. I charged the case as soon as I got it and then didn't charge it for around 12 days and it's still working and on everyday basis I used the buds for 4-5 times .. I used it for 5 hours continuously with 2-3 hrs of gaming and video streaming and still 30% was left.. And if you use the buds at 55-60%(which I guess is the best because it's very loud) volume it will surely last for 6-6½ hrs.. Buds gets charged very quickly I guess within 20-25 mins of putting them back into the case.. The case takes around 1hr 15 mins or so to get fully charged.. ****** ONE THING I'LL LIKE TO ADD IS, I USED IT WITH MY MACBOOK AND I NOTICED THE VOLUME WAS EXTREMELY LOW BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF USED WITH ANY MOBILE, IT'S VOLUME IS REALLY HIGH. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MACBOOK'S PROBLEM OR EARBUDS'S, BUT I DON'T MIND AND IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS FOR USING WITH LAPTOPS I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO CHECK THIS ISSUE WITH SOMEONE ELSE BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING FOR USING IT WITH PHONES THEN JUST GO FOR IT.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 15 June 2020,varun,Must buy if you are a basshead,"If you are a fan of bass like I am, hell, you are gonna love these airdopes. I have been using Boat products for a while and haven't gone unsatisfied even if I feel the durability of said products could have been more. Sometimes, one earbuds stop to work. Happened many times. I had a boat 225 and then a Boat 255 Pro. But they had got one thing in common -- BASS. I'm a basshead and Boat products are a sure shot recommend.. Of late, I had been researching a lot of true wireless earbuds. I checked out several including Redmi Earbuds S, MI TWS Earbuds, Blaupunkt BTW-01, Realme Earbuds X TWS, and a few others. I settled, however, on Boat 441 Airdopes as I have built this trust factor with Boat products and am very skeptical of going to any other, especially Boat really offers their audio equipments at an affordable price. I watched a lot of reviews for these Airdopes and settled on it finally. I am usually a paranoid person, but I am glad to say that I am satisfied at the moment with what I have purchased.. This is a 3-day usage review. I will edit this review as I pass the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month marks. On the basis of my usage, I will let you know why I recommend it.. Let me talk about the Amazon delivery first. Contactless and on time delivery even in these pandemic times. So, salute to the delivery heroes who are functioning even in these risky and dangerous times. Salute boss!. The box came with a charging case that had two earbuds inside it, an advertisement foldable pamphlet, a USB Type-C cable, an instruction manual and a plastic case of two extra earbuds and hooks.. The earbuds were at 80% charge when it arrived, but I had it charged full as soon as I opened the case. At 100% audio volume, the airdopes have been lasting me about 3 hours and 45 minutes, which is decent for this price. The buds fit extremely well, except that they have fallen off a couple of time (but that maybe because of my ears). However, I have no complaints because I really think I didn't insert them into my ears fully and that's why they fell. Regardless, they are also comfortable and even after 3.5 hours, I haven't felt any discomfort or pain. So, all in all the quality of the earbuds (premium plastic) is awesome. I will give it a 4.5/5 for comfort and build quality.. Note: After 20-days of usage, I have no complaint regarding the fit. Although they do seem to come out sometimes when your ears get too sweaty. So, moisture might cause them to come out. But it has only been a rare moment they did. I live in Mumbai, a humid city, and I haven't seen them come out a lot. But it did come out a couple of times during one workout.. The charging case is premium quality too. It charges to full capacity in about two hours, which is good. It has a neat finish to it. I love the black on it and the red inside. Yes, I bought the Raging Red option. Boat only has black and red for now. More colors will be coming according to their Facebook page. However, I have always loved red.. Inside the charging case, the earbuds have their own slots. Magnets are perfect.. I wish the battery in both the earbuds lasted more than 4 hours but that's what they tell us in their features list. So, it gave me exactly that. It does its job, but I wish it had a 6 hour playback at least. But then for this price, maybe it is worth it. I think this is where Boat lacks. It provides a minimum playback compared to its competitors.. Note: After 20 days of usage, I felt that the touch sensitivity could be better. The one-touch pause and play works for music player but doesn't work for Netflix and Prime and other apps. Which is weird. It starts music player again if song is in player queue. Maybe if I do a factory reset, it will be better. Will let you know regarding this. It might be a problem with mine alone because a few days ago, the touch sensitivity was awesome. Regardless, the sensitivity is still top-notch. I am finding the functionality confusing.. Battery Life: 4/5. Coming to calling, I think it did its job good. I could hear the other person's voice clearly. And I could hear him too. So I will give it a 4.5/5.. Note: I'd not recommend this for calling but it does its job. Noise cancellation is decent.. Lastly, I am coming to the best aspect of these airdopes. The Sound quality. Bass is just awesome. Trebles and mids are decent. Vocals are good. I just enjoy listening to the songs on these airdopes. The beats are awesome. They are more or less similar to Boat 255 Pro Bluetooth, maybe even slightly better. So, sound quality, 5/5.. Overall, I think this is the best true wireless buds you can find on a shoestring budget. Fit, quality, sound, noise cancellation, all good. Affordable too. So, I do recommend these airdopes if you are looking for something in the price range of 1.5k INR - 3.5k INR.. Note: Boat Airdopes 441 and 451 are not much different. So, just the color.. And ah yes, forgot, these airdopes have got IPx6 waterproofing. I haven't tested it as yet and don't want to risk it, but I gather that it will protect the buds from sweat and water droplets. :). Note: I am now 7 months into using this. The earphones still work with the same quality as received. However, there's a little glitch. Whenever the battery percentage drops by 10 or 20 per cent, it seems to disconnect. It reconnects automatically, but it can get annoying. Doesn't happen every time, but there's a frequency. Tried calling on these earphones as well. Good quality. Earphones run for at least 3.5 hours and a single battery charge for the case gives at least 3-4 charges. So, all in all, good.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Having said that, firstly the replaced product was not same in color and secondly this one was faulty too where the touch pad of the right earpod was not working.😠 Again being frustrated I raised another complaint with Boat. This time it took at least 3 weeks of time(which is okay with me as compared to the delay experience i had earlier) to get this faulty product replaced.. Finally, I was happy with this 2nd time replaced product, everything in this one seemed perfect. But it has been just 15 days since I received the airdopes and now I find that the right ones battery gets exhausted within 15-20 mins after a full charge whereas the left one with the same amount of charge can run for more than an hour.. I don't know what's wrong with this product or what's wrong with the Boat guys. This is literally frustrating for any customer.

Reviewed in India on 4 September 2020,Sayantani,Awesome earbuds,"Just bought this boat 441 two days back. Here are my initial impressions after using for two days.. So i am not an audiophile or something, but used pretty decent earphones from boat, sennheiser, samsung, sony, philips, mi, mivi etc. So after some research, i settled for this as it is not too much expensive. I did not opt for fast delivery, still amazon delivered within 2 days. Packaging was good and product was nicely sealed. Little surprised to see that the box was so small. It is funny that on the box very tactfully written made in P.R.C. The capsule shaped charging case is small, light weight, very much pocketable, and sturdy because of the build quality and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. There is a led indicator defines charging status. Its nice to have a c-type port as it is future safe because nowadays almost every smartphones comes with c-type port. This comes in vibrant colours and i purchased the blue one. The buds are light weight and feels sturdy in hand. However, the fit was not good for me so i changed the shark fin rubber with the smaller one given in the box, also changed the ear tips to the smallest one given and now it fits perfectly to my ears. Well, fit is subjective, so i guess you should also play around with the extras to see which one fits you perfectly. The grip is really nice as i use it while brisk walking and doing little exercises and it never fall from my ears. Some users says there is some static noise problem but i didn't have this problem as of now. The touch sensitivity is pretty good and accurate, however, there can be accidental touch sometimes when trying to adjust the earbuds. I guess with time you will get to used to this thing. Now coming to the sound quality, it is definitely bass heavy with good trebles and vocals. The bass is not muddy but punchy, and didn't hurt my ears. Highs, lows and mids are clear. The sound signature is pretty good. Didn't noticed any latency during media consumptions, but can't comment about gaming latency as im a non-gamer. Volume can go very high, connection with my smartphone is quite fast and stable, range is pretty good. Didn't went outdoor, but indoor calling was good and the other party never realised i was on BT earphone. Once right side earbud stopped after i took it out of the box for a long time without connecting to the phone, but then i just put them back at the box and closed the lid and then after opening everything was working fine again. Can't judge the battery life as i am just using it for 2 days, but the buds charges pretty fast.. Cons: Couldn't find any till now, and hope i won't be able to find any in near future.. I hope my experience helps you decide whether to go for this earbuds on not. Thanks.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It takes up at any point, the slightest of touches and that MIGHT be irritating at times. 5. Sound - in one word, GOOD! Actually good is being really vague. The bass is punchy but not overwhelming. Bassheads will not be really sad with this. Instrument separation is good even though the mids are a little muffled. Pure vocal artists will lose the edge there. The punch will be really high in songs like Get Lucky, Madness etc. So yes, for this price point, the sound is good.. 6. Fit - perfect fit, doesn’t fall off. But sadly, very subjective, hurts my ears after 45 minutes or so. If your ears don’t hurt, go nuts doing any exercise you want.. 7. Passive noise cancellation - brilliant but with an underside of not hearing ANYTHING AT ALL from outside. So keep that in mind and do the needful when out wearing them..

Fit: originally fitted fins and buds were bigger than my ear and causing a but pain. I have changed to smaller buds and fins and after they fits better.. Still NOT best fit, but alright.. As they are on a bit tighter side in fit, there is just no chance that they fall off.. They wont fall even if one is running. But if you are using them for more that 3 hours straight, they causes pain in ears.. Controls: nice crontrols. But thing is they are very sensitive, means even on a call a slight adjustment just cuts the call.. On call sound: just BAD. If other person is on a good network with a good phone, they can hear you a bit clearly but everyone else, they just struggle to get your voice.. Just not meant for calls. Mono use: both bids can be used separately for every single job, including calls also.. If battery is a issue with you, just put one in case and use one, after a while start using other and put first one in case.. Overall: nice purchase for 2500. I also own boat rockerz 255 and rockerz sound is better than these airdopes. But these have almost infinite batteries.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I thought it would go away after some time, unfortunately even after 1-2 days, it did not. I tried it with my OnePlus 5T, Windows laptop, iPad, all of them gave the sound on the left side. The right side worked without issue. So I thought it might be a faulty product and ordered a replacement, and when the replacement arrived, it still had the same issue. It is very annoying and highly noticeable at times like dialogues without any music/ scenes when there is not much audio in movies, especially at volumes anything lower than 25%. Above that, if it is boomy music, it gets masked and you can't hear it, but it is still there as I could hear it during silent parts.. Apart from this issue, the bass on this is pretty unsatisfactory, although it might be okay as compared to some cheap wired earphones..

It sounds very muddled, as if you are talking under water. Another major problem is one of the earphones randomly shuts off within 30mins of use and cannot be used again before putting it back in the charging case. This is disappointing for me as bought these with the intend to wear them on long cycling sessions (min 1hr).. I am an audiophile, so would like to talk mostly about audio quality. I bought these for casual listening, specially for cycling in monsoon. The highs and mids are pretty decent for the price you pay, but when it comes to low frequencies, the bass is too boomy for my liking (note: this is coming from a guy who likes to listen to his music on vinyl). The bass is not tight and is all-over the low ends which causes highs and mids to subside. Having said that, they are decent pair of earphones and are pretty manageable (sound quality wise) even for an audiophile like me. Would have given 5 stars, had they kept the bass under control.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Subsequent device pairing is excruciatingly painful due to the above issue of touch controls. The instructions says long press 5 secs to turn off and long press 3 secs to turn off.

(Ive noticed the failure only when my phone is connected to my amazfit watch also. And my watch also has music control, i suspect that could be the reason).. 3. The noise cancellation is purely by virtue of the snug fit of the ear buds. Similar to a passive noise cancellation.. 4. The microphone is decent, but picks up a lot of ambient noise. So a call in a public place will be a problem for the person you talk to.(multiple callers i spoke to mentioned too much background voices etc).. 5. Finally the sound stage/profile being too bass centric. Most songs can get by, but sometimes the bass just over powers everything else. Some tweaking of the equaliser may help..

These get out of the ear very easily and you won't be able to use them. Forget running, these cannot be used even for basic home workout. Non-Stickiness into the ear is a huge issue with these.. After using it for 2 months left ear bud stopped working so I had complained on there website after which they replaced it but in the 2nd set that they sent the same issue arised after a month now they are not even accepting the complaint even though it is in warranty period.. Sound quality is okayish and please don't except something spectacular. Bass is not apt.. Overall a much hyped product - and boAt has spent way too much on advertising, focusing less on the quality. I won't be buying any other product given the experience I had with these.. Not worth even for 2499 - Maximum price for these should have been 999.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Insta pair works very well but beware the case is very slippery dues to matte plastic as least for me and cannot be opened with one hand at least not easily. The case hinge could have been better but it does feel premium in hand compared to other earbuds in this range. The bass is quite overpowering which I don't like cause it kills the actual music quality unless you like too much base. However on non bassy music it is good not great. You get a Type-C cable in box and 3 extra ear tips and 1 extra ear hook along with usual BoAt promotional stuff. Battery lasts for around 4-5 hrs on an individual bud. Fit my ear perfectly and won't fall off even while jogging. Although keep in mind the touch controls are very sensitive which is good but while removing them out of the case or your ear can accidentally reject calls , pause your content or reset the buds due to triple taps as the buds are small so you are definitely going to have accidental touches a lot. However the recent price drop in the Great Indian sale from 2499 to 1999 felt like a kick in the nuts because I bought them a week before the sale.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 9 August 2020,Mrinmoy Roy,One week into it and still Wow.,"Just delivered. Started using it. Not going into techno babble, I am going to record my initial observations:. 1. One day delivery by Amazon. Got it at Rs. 2499.. 2. Great packing by BoAt, looks neat and organized.. 3. A bit heavier case considering the extra juice stored in the battery to be used as a power bank in case of 'emergencies'.. 4. Instant battery level indicator on the case by pressing an associated button on the front of the case.. 5. Instant searching by the pods when I opened the case, denoted by blinking green light (looks cool).. 6. On pairing mode the ring of light alternates in green and blue light, the pairing is easy and hassle free.. 7. The sound after connecting is something I wouldn't say as balanced but on the bass heavy side, but Boat sure knows to make bass heavy earpieces.. 8. As happened with my earlier Boat wired earpieces, the default eartips/buds had to be replaced with the largest of the extra tips provided in the box and like my previous experience, the sound quality changed and became more balanced although it was still bass heavy and if one can corre tly set equalizer values, the sound may sound better. It is my personal viewpoint and observations.. 9. The touch may seem to be confusing as the number of tap one has to make and I found that I made more taps than what I should have reuired to do for changing to next track and thus was annoying. However, I believe to be adapted to it after more use. However, having said that, I felt that the after-tap response is a miniscule bit late thereby creating the confusion of tapping.. 10. There is no volume control option in the earpiece but I found a novel way to do so by pairing both these airdopes and Honor band 5 (with a music control update) with my mobile phone. It worked and still works like magic and guess it is more cool to do so by changing, pausing, controlling volume by a smart band rather than tapping on the airdopes.. 11. Tested call in outdoors and indoors- in home and in a moving car with other people present. In quieter environment the call is clearer. Having said that for both the cases, the call was quite good even if not HD quality. Still haven't used in a street call. Will update the call quality after another few days of usage.. 12. The ring of light across the touch area is a dope. I really liked it amd was one of the reason in buying this airdopes, but sadly, I found that they were not lighting up when the song plays and lights up only when certain functions happen. Green for charged condition and searching, Blue-green alternate for pairing and red when tapped on the earpiece. I don't know whether that feature can be turned off or not in these airdopes.. 13. The battery of the airdopes stood out to 50% after 3 hours of continuous music usage. The battery indicator light on the case has four dots and after 5 hours, 3 dots were visible, thus I conclude that there will be ample juice left for the whole day for a heavy usage.. WILL UPDATE AFTER ANOTHER ONE WEEK USAGE.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It comes with an instruction manual on how the touch feature works etc. The quality of sound is pretty good as well and I mostly got it for my gymming and gaming so that I do not have to worry about any wires. It's also useful for people who are listening to audio books or college lectures so that they can keep the phone at a distance and do their work by listening side by side. The waterproof feature means your sweat or rain will not affect the sound quality which is useful esp for sports purposes. The light up feature is great for locating the Airdopes in the dark which was useful for my gaming. And I'm able to listen wireless with hands free convinience. The range of the bluetooth connection is really good too! It also came with a charging case and a USB cable for charging. This product is probably the best purchase I have made so far and I'm really happy with it!. .. Few ways the product can be improved: Many a times when I pair it to a different device, only one of the earplugs work. And the other one doesnt. So I have to put it back into the charger again and then again take it out. I would suggest that there should be a button only for mono mode to prevent it from randomly connecting to only one earplug. But thats just a suggestion I have. Also the USB cord is really small. I think it should be a little bit longer, but I can connect my type C phone cord too it as well. Rest I am happy with my purchase. Thank you :]",5.0 out of 5 stars

Everybody has a different preference and thus taking into consideration this thing you may accordingly plan your purchase.. I'm a not the active user of social media nor the YouTube, yet I really feel that this Earbuds are great for my usage as I earlier used the Samsung EarPhones which had a really nice sound and this too is the same.. I haven't yet turned my media volume to more than 40% still the Audio is loud and clear for me. This also depends on the device you use as every device has it's own hardware capability. Even I use it at 25% volume it feels me not to go beyond this level.. The images will make most things clear with respect to its appearance and design and the extra eartips included In the box.. Points that you must take into account is:. 1: Your mobile device hardware capability( not the processor but the audio output ). 2: Your Usage in aggregate. 3: Your priority as to battery backup as it has 2600 mAh case. ( This 441 pro has a smaller variant boAt 441 similar to it priced lower than this which has everything same but, a smaller battery case). 4: Futher my order of usage will make it easier to think as if similar matches yours: Online Classes/ Lectures sometimes live lecture too ; Music Songs ; YouTube ;. Hence you must prior to purchase look after this and make a confident purchase.. Conclusion:- I was earlier thought to purchase a cheap Chinese brand TWS, but later thought to increase my budget to get Earbuds from an Indian company rather than other chinese brand which merely does any innovation yet charges a considerable high price, leading them to their higher profit margin.. boAt is an Indian Brand and this earbuds matched my usage and thus I loved them.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 2 October 2020,Bella Lui,boAt Airdopes 441 TWS Ear-Buds with IWP Technology,"Choosing boAt Airdopes 441 over another brand came down to affordability, and durability. Sure there are much more expensive, and cheaper earbuds, but being spoilt for choice, the boAt Airdopes 441 met my needs. Many prospective buyers who are curious about the origins of the boAt brand? The boAt Airdopes is an Indian consumer electronics brand company who manufacture a fantastic product. For some readers, this review could be long, please bear with me.. The reason I bought these earbuds was primarily for hands-free phone conversations with family and friends - giving me the freedom to move away from the handset. The distance of 10 meters mentioned on the instruction manual should be sufficient for most users, provided there are no physical barriers such as walls, doors, and other interference between the Bluetooth signal and the handset. For me, the boat 441 earbuds performed well up to a distance of about 6 meters. But, because of walls between the earbuds and the handset, the calls dropped, and then reconnected once I moved closer to the handset. Without obstructions, the Bluetooth signal should travel the distance of 10 meters comfortably as mentioned in the instruction manual.. The instructions in the manual are straightforward and easy to follow. The boAt Airdopes 441 can be used individually, or together for TWS (True Wireless Stereo) listening - perfect for my needs. And besides, if the need arose the earbuds can be factory reset due to malfunctioning, not paring with the handset, or in general, problems with connectivity. The 70-hour (2 hours short of 3 days), standby for the earbuds when in its cradle lets you take it with you when on the move – excellent.. What about sound? Well, the 6mm drivers on the earbuds are excellent. There’s lot of bass for bass-heads out there. Considering, prior to buying the earbuds, I rarely listened to music on the handset; now the earbuds are getting a workout. A word of advice - the sound quality could get addictive.. The short charging time is excellent for the casual user like myself. I did drain the charging case unknowingly, and when I plugged the case back in, I noticed a mauve / red circle around the blue pulsating light to inform me the charging case is completely, or close to being drained of its charge. Once it begins to charge, the mauve / red circle disappears, while the blue light continues to pulsate. And when the case and the earbuds are fully charged, the pulsating blue light returns to a steady blue. The only downside to the charging experience was the rather short charging cord.. The other nice attribute about the boAt 441 Airdopes are they connect using IWP (Insta Wake N’ Pair) technology with your handset. That’s after the earbuds have been paired with the handset. The touch controls are sensitive to either end, or begin a call, or music track. The one option the earbuds don’t have is volume control; it’s got to be done on the handset.. I’ve had the boAt 441 Airdopes now for over a month, had a couple of hiccups, which were eventually ironed out. With proper care and handling, hope to get descent miles in the coming years. Incidentally, if you don’t hear any sound in your earbuds? Check if they are paired correctly with the handset, and powered up – fully charged.. Lastly, the boAt 441 Airdopes is an excellent pair of earbuds, which deserves 5 stars!. Hope this review was helpful.",5.0 out of 5 stars

And after using BoAt Airdopes 441, I can say for a fact that these are generations better than Airdots. Not only do they have extremely rich sound quality, but the bass is very noticeablely deep. The fit is very nice, and can be used while working out. The battery is everlasting, and the biggest pro about these wireless earbuds is the bluetooth 5.0 as it's extremely quick, and easy to connect.

Reviewed in India on 23 August 2020,VINAY A.,Excellent sound. Decent build quality. Touch sensor button,"I'm giving my honest feedback after using Boat Airdopes 441, Boat Airdopes 121 and pTron Bassbuds. If anyone have questions on comparison please ask ans I will try to reply all.. Value for Money : Yes.👍 I would say it would be best buy if priced between ₹1600-₹1800.. Sound Quality: Very good 👍 The bass and treble sharing is good. Its more on the bass side. Not excellent but not annoying. You will enjoy some good music in these buds.. Noise Cancellation: Yes 👍 I should warn you not to use while doing anything that requires your attention. Even if its raining heavily outside you wont hear a thing.. Bass Quality : On a scale from 1 to 5 I would give a 4.. Audio: Doesn't hurt your eardrums if you maintain volume between 30%-70%. 121model sounds best around 50% while 441model sounds best around 70%.. Body: Perfect 👌 The case is hard and lid is tight enough. Its magnetic lid hence its not as tight as a groove. However lid wont open by itself.. Battery: Pretty Good battery life. Both on buds and case. Lasts almost 4-6 hours based on usage. U can charge 3 full and a little bit more on both earbuds.. Design & Fit : Very sleek design and fits perfectly inside ear. Can't make out that u r wearing it. Use suitable silicon buds. The extra grip included in design keeps the earplug intact. It wont fall even while jogging or dancing.. Features : Added features include touch sensitive buttons. U need not press which makes it less annoying bcoz pressing a button when it is stuck deep inside ear is irritating. It includes Water Resistance, you wont get in trouble in slight drizzle or droplets of water/sweat on the button.. Calling : I didn't find any problem in calls however I wouldn't suggest this for calling. The other person might hear your voice aa if inside a tunnel. Gradually call quality will decrease, I speculate.. Final Opinion ::. Its a very good product. I felt price could have been lesser. Fits inside ear perfectly and sound is too good. Battery doesn't drain fast. However your phone battery might, if continuously connected.. The only gripe I have is that due to touch input we may tend to pause audio or open Google Assistance by mistake. Its very sensitive. You cannot wear and sleep because even if it touches your pillow surface audio will stop.. I hope this feedback helps you decide better.. Regards. Vinay Acharya",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 24 January 2021,Bassman,Here's my review of the product,"Sound quality:- Good for it's price range. The sound leans a little bit on the treble side but it has sufficient lows. I was actually surprised by the sound quality considering that it is a bluetooth earphone at the 2.5k range. Controls:- The touch sensitive controls are hit-or-miss. They are very well done and very responsive but the downside is that, it's easy to trigger it unintentionally. If your ear itches or you want to adjust your hair or something else, you can accidentally ""press"" the button by gliding your finger over it. Another issue is when using it when lying down, if any skin (usually earlobes or auricle) glazes over the touch sensitive buttons, your video/song might accicentally pause or if it rests on it for 3 or more seconds, the device can accidentally turn off. But mind you, it's just minor issue and not a delibitating one. I'm just noting it down here for future improvements.. Connectivity:- This is one thing I love about these earphones compared to others I have owned. It connects easily with your phone, as well as with the other. For example:- You're using only one of the buds, with the other one in the box; after sometime you want to use both of them, you only have to take it out, it'll turn on and sync itself automatically with the other bud. I'm just mentioning this here because with every other bud I have owned, you need to manually resync both buds everytime.. Latency:- This earbuds have a signal latency/delay of 200ms. This is pretty low compared to other earbud and neckbands I have tried out and owned. Latency is a non-issue for basic usage but is a big issue for gamers, and 200ms signal latency is very very forgiveable for games (eg:- codm, pubgm, etc) and this is the most useable earbud/neckband I have used for gaming so far (for the record I have tried out 5-7k inr earbuds that have 500-600ms latency.. and this little guy beats them all). As per my experience, any delay that is at or below 200ms delay is useable/forgiveable for gaming. Anything above 200ms, is useless. Sure, zero latency wired earphones are the best for gaming but given this product comes under 2.5k, have good sound quality and connectivity, the ease of use and quality-of-life thing they offer is a very good compromise for the 200ms delay.. Overall:- This is an excellent product for it's price range and I recommend it for basic usage as well as gaming",4.0 out of 5 stars

Starting off with sound quality, it's amazing... while ordering them I thought since they have just 6mm drivers, there loudness might be low but that's not the case here. I compared them with OnePlus bullets and boat rockerz 255 pro and they beat OnePlus ones and stand at same level with rockerz. Bass is nice, trebles are good, overall 4.5/5 for sound.. Connectivity- it's super fast. As soon as you open them they connect automatically to previously connected device in 1-3 seconds.. Coming to comfort- I'm disappointed. They give such a strong grip that they started pain in my ears after 5-10 minutes of usage. I was not able to use them for even 30-40 minutes. Now the thing is everyone's ear size is different so I can't say how will they fit on you but for mine they are super tight in medium size and loose in large ones. After trying to diagnose the issue, I found out that the part in my ears where the wings of the buds fit to provide grip is not so big (i.e. my ears are not big enough though I'm 18) because of that they were paining a lot. So if you have small space above your ear canal then you will also feel the same issue like me. In the end had to return them, I felt bad as they sounded amazing but they were tight.. Overall they have amazing sound quality but not so good comfort (at least for me) . If you are okay with it, you can go with them else look for something else. Thank you !",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 20 October 2020,A R,Decent true wireless earphones for the price,"This review is after 2 months of daily use. I got these in Aug'20 for 1999/-.. The buds and the box is made of plastic and is very light. There is no premium feel to it.. They are a good deal when compared to other earbuds for the same price range. On an average the ear buds last for approx 3 hrs on a single charge. The box and the buds together last for almost 20 hours. Charging time is approx 2 hours. The earbuds have a audible battery indicator which says ""Oops Battery Low"" when the battery level in the buds drop to around 10%. There is also a battery indicator that is displayed in the notification bar of your phone.. Considering that both the batteries in the earbuds are the same, the right earbud battery drains more quickly than the left. The left will work for another 30-45 minutes after the right one has died.. The sound quality is good however the bass is a little to much. However, Boats are known for their high bass earphones. A Boat app with equalizer and other functions would have really made a difference, however there is no equalizer option, neither can you change or control the volumes through the ear buds.. The audio quality and clarity during calls is good.. The Bluetooth reception however is not too great. The buds tend to loose connection with your phone at a distance of approx 15/18 feet. Sometimes a single wall between me and my phone can make it loose connection.. The capacitive buttons work well but are a little too sensitive. If you accidently touch the bud when you touch your head or ear, it will register as a press and will pause or change the track.. Will need to see how they perform over the period of time..

Got myself a BoAt airdopes 441 Pro on 26th Oct sale costing me 2250 INR and got it delivered the next day. I like classic black colour so don't judge those pics.. Now let's go see in detail what i got at this price -. A charging case with 2500mAH capacity -. came in 75% charged in box.. case has the left(L) and right(R) pods mentioned, glad to see this small detail from BoAt.. A flat wire USB-C cable roughly 1 ft in length (top right in pic).. 3 pairs of SML ear plugs. 1 extra M sized plug is affixed to earpods itself.. 1 extra pair of rubber sleeve (top left in pic). Really mindful of BoAt to include an extra pair.. Now let's talk about the real issues.. Build and visuals -. Earpods are made of plastic but sturdy and feel well made.. Pods look quite small in size at first but are heavier once placed in your ears. Heaviness takes its toll gradually on your ears and you may feel it all the time.. The EarPods are bit slippery when clutched in fingers and may fall if not handled properly.. Touch surface is decorated with RGB lighting and looks awesome.. Material of provided sleeves and eartips is also of good quality and soft to touch.. Charging case is a bit bulkier compared to basic model given larger battery size. The flap (top lid) I felt to be a bit flimsy compared to entire case, could have been a bit heavier.. Usage -. The EarPods are rated at 35mAH each with a usage time of 5 hours playback. I have been using it non-stop at 50-60% sound output and for me it has lasted for more than 5 hours in continuous usage.. Touch controls are good addition as it eases a lot of operational headaches however response could be a bit better. I found that after pausing the music I could put my hands down easily before playback was actually paused.. You can use each EarPod separately and it is able to function on its own for both music and calls.. Call quality is actually quite decent which was a bit surprising for me for such price range.. Controls are simple -. Single touch for play/pause and receiving calls (any ear).. Double touch left earpod for previous, right for next and any of them for ending call.. Long press for deactivate/shutdown the EarPods.. EarPods feedbacks with ringtones when turning on/off or (un)pairing.. They automatically get disabled after a few minutes if disconnected.. Could not muster up courage to test IPX7 water proofing but if any brave soul can muster up the courage, put your results here. :P. Sound/Music Quality. Great, for this price range). I have been using MI In-ear pro wired headset for last 3 years and it’s comparable to that with better bass.. It’s a bit Bass heavy but hey most of us like that, don’t we ;). Sound I found a bit muffled and soft when on call but everything was clear for communication.. Range. Haven’t tested range of 10 meters in open area but indoors could at most walk 3 meters with wall(s) in between. I found sound to be breaking when beyond 2 walls (6 in thick).. Still need to check call quality in open and loud areas. Will do that once out of house at a busy hour.. As a general user, so far I have found the airdrops 441 pro to be of my liking. I hope you will also feel the same.. The star rating on Amazon does not do justice to this product and should be between 4 and 4.2 stars.. Go for it.

The airdopes 441 pro are fully identical with airdopes 441 in terms of sound, bass, quality, feel and size and shape . Only difference is in their charging case, which is of 500mAh in airdopes 441 and 2600mAh in airdopes 441 pro.. Go for the pro version only if you get it for 2500 else as airdopes 441 costs only 1999 with no major differences.. Pros -. Good bass and balanced audio between 65-75% volume.. Extra sensitive touch controls.. Very good passive noise cancellation.. Good calling quality.. Cons -. It hurts sometimes because of the fin shaped rubber (I dont know if the problem is with everyone because fitting is different for everyone as everyone's ears are of different shape). Sometime when watching youtube videos, the left earbud produces static noise and the right one gives the video sound. It only happened with old youtube videos, on watching recent videos I didn't came across this issue.. Vocals are on little low side when listening below 60%. Final verdict - If you're looking for any good TWS under 5k then nothing is better than airdopes 441 and 441 pro.. Go for it without any second thoughts.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 20 September 2020,Anoop,A PowerBank that pretends to be a 'True Wireless' earphones!!,"I purchased this on the Prime day sale, thinking it would be one of a kind, 'true wireless' earphones with the inbuilt 2600mAH power bank. Well, I stand dissappointed!!. Well, if you are looking for a power bank you'll get something better in Rs. 500. You don't need to spend, so much money on a power bank that pretends to be a earphone. Actually, I can't blame boat for this, their marketing was spot on, and not to forget the amount of paid reviews on YouTube were all a catalyst for this buying. Anyway, I'll give you an honest review about my experience with this power bank aka ✌️true wireless ✌️. Pros:. 1. Power bank (2600mAh, you can even charge your phone, only for emergencies), else it gives you around 120 hours of earphones playback time.. 2. Good ear plugs, and the added fins around it fits perfectly within your ear lobes. Doesn't slip out or cause discomfort.. 3. Decent bass, and loud.. Cons:. 1. Battery Backup - The problem with this earphones is that the discharge rate way higher than any earphones I've used. Playback /call time is way less than 4.5hrs as claimed by the boat. On a single charge, for calls got around 2hrs and for music playback 2.5hrs. These are individuals stats, but if you're doing both of these activities, you'll get an average of 2hrs.. 2. Call Quality: Single Pod - Not at all clear and crisp as mentioned by many YouTube and Amazon reviewers. I've always had people telling me from the other end that, they can't hear me clearly or the voice they hear echoes. When you use both the earphones, the voice is a little clear but not to a greater extent. This is not something you would expect from a Rs. 3500 earphones( current rate, I got it for 2500).. 3. Connectivity : The earphones keeps disconnecting from the phone, and that's when I've my phone in my pocket. At first, I thought probably my phone is behaving weird, but I tried my friend's phone, and it kept disconnecting. It also keeps disconnecting from my laptop as well. So, I see no point why anyone should buy this when the sole purpose of being a true wireless has already been defeated.. I rest my case.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 21 February 2021,Prashanth,Not comfortable in the ear,"Got it yesterday.. these are the views of one day usage.. Pros:. - Big battery (2600mah) case makes it easy to handle the buds instead of charging it everyday.. - Connects to my phone as soon as under 2 seconds of case opening.. Cons:. - Buds doesn't fit in ears correctly, I tried with all silicon ear pieces that they gave.. - The silicon ear pieces provided are bit tougher than what I got for my other wired phones. - There is no place to hold the earbuds without touching the captive touch sensor which is not convenient (we end up answering the call while keeping the first ear bud in the ear and ending the call while keeping the second one. Very bad design). - Earbuds battery level are not properly being displayed in the phone. - Earbuds charge very quickly... Like in maybe 10-15 mins or so... Which is weird... I think they are not properly displaying the battery level.. - Not comfortable in the ear, this button earbud design is hard to handle than the aripods design. Airpods just sit in the ear canal... These have to be pushed inside the ear canal and lock them for it to be properly be in the ear.. - Sound is not that good.. I would say close to average quality... I feel good when I take them out of my ear.. you get my point with this sentance.. Am planning to check for another day or so and see if I should keep them or return.. The only reason I am still thinking of keeping these for now is the Big battery case.. Will edit the post after 2-3 days for more info.. Edit1:. I returned it on 3rd day as it was hurting my ears while keeping them on.. I learned that we don't need that Big battery case as in general cases we can't completely drain the buds and case charging in a day or two.. The sound quality is not good as its bass is not equally distributed is what I felt.. There are other better options in the same price range like oneplus buds z and other brand TWS..

Its built is awesome and durable. It looks cool. Call audio is good can't say the best one but its still good. The CTC touch is highly sensitive and responsive. I First orderd it and one side of its touch wasn't working properly, it responded only sometimes and the response time was too slow... After 2 days the touch completely gave up i thought it'll eventually recover, but naah it got worse and at last stopped working. I ordered a replacement for that and it is completely functional and working to its max potential.... If you want to go deeper into sound quality.... It produces the lows and mids nicely. But the highs are only good when you turn the volume at 80%+ at this point the vocals and highs suppress the bass and at this volume the lows aren't much prominent.... But at the same time at 60% which is also known as the sweet spot for most of the TWS earphones they just perform great...

Pros. 1.Bass quality is very good and punchy.. 2.Battery life is good .It easily lasts for 4-5 hrs on single use.As for the case I need to charge it once in 7-8 days . Case is also sleek and acceptable size and fits into any trouser pocket easily.. 3. Connectivity is one of the biggest plus points.Its IWP function really works like a charm. There is absolutely no lag in connection once u take out the earbuds from the case. 4.Fit and comfortability is excellent..U can wear it for 2-3 hrs at a stretch without any discomfort or pain in ears. After that it might get a bit uncomfortable,but I guess that's the case with almost all the TWS earbuds available in the market. Cons:. 1.Call quality is ok in quiet environment..but in crowded places it is very poor. I have to remove the earbuds and speak directly over the phone when I'm im travelling.. 2 .Noise cancellation is only passive,not active. 3. Sometimes one of the earbuds stops working when u remove it from your ear even for a few seconds.But the problem is immediately rectified when u put both the earbuds in the case,close it and take them out again. Overall a good buy, considering the price range. I would recommend these earbuds for their decent sound quality,good battery life , and ultra fast connectivity.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Bass is so good that I don't hesitate comparing it with Bose TWS that costs around 18k.. People going around saying that it doesn't have noise cancellation. Well yes you can say it doesn't cancel out the noise when you're talking to someone on calls and the other person can hear your background noise on the other side of the call (but that thing is acceptable because it happens in the case of bare naked phones too). but when you are listening to songs, I must tell you it doesn't let you hear whatever is going on the outside. Moreover, when you put on these buds, it already cancels out 50% of the noise whatever is going on around you.. It has a massive battery backup (yeah that's why they're taking 1k more than the normal version). The only shortcoming I found was, in low volume (less than 40% vol) the songs feel empty(I mean it doesn't give much bass and the treble is also low, the sound is flat) but hey who's gonna keep the volume low, right? Turn it up to 60% and there you go! feel the nirvana !",5.0 out of 5 stars

Lights,Bluetooth connectivity, battery backup , phone charge option, sound quality, touch sensitivity everything is working properly without any issues. Phone call clarity is also good. You can go for it. Because it is giving 150 hours of battery backup which is huge. Also in emergency you can charge your phone from it. Charging speed is also good. So it is quickly charge case as well as buds. Bought this at 2499rs price ,441 pro. I'll update over all performance after long usage.

Good for music in this price range.. 4. Solid( I have dropped some time but nothing happened). Cons -. 1.

Noise cancellation is the most disappointing factor, even in cycling the air sound is so much that my voice is not clear ( you can’t hear anything) then forget about bike. I was in canteen and told to my friend to record the call, when I heard it ,I was not able to get any of my word.. 3. They are in ear type , So they fit to your ear and seal the ear canal , so I hear my own voice While talking and it’s frustrating, may be it happens to every tws but with this I can’t use both the ear piece. I usually use one of them otherwise I hear my own body movements , I can hear my steps during walk internally .. 4.no Volume Adjustment. Though I dint feel any prob with this. 5. If you are laying down in bed due to the touch by ear your call may disconnect sometime. ( don’t know this is prob or not but it happens with me sometimes). 6.

Cons:. 1) Learning curve involved to understand all features and touch controls. 2) Light coding can get a bit confusing at times (but this is more of a feedback to UX designers of this product and has no performance impact on the buds once you've got a hang of all that those lights mean). 3) For some people, battery back up can be a bit less but please do take a look at the size and weight; plus, don't forget the mono mode",5.0 out of 5 stars

Noise cancellation is decent for this price range but you will notice the better difference when calling.. So why is Boult so bad well they have tried but bass is very low even though there buds are bigger bass is low and sound quality is decent.. it's tooo touch sensitive which leads in accidental clicking.. although when you intentionally try to use the touch due to its large surface are you may feel hard to get used to the right place to touch. Also boat has been in the audio way longer than Boult so there audio optimization is better. So I honestly suggest go for boat 441.,4.0 out of 5 stars

So I am using the airdopes for last 2-3 days. Sound quality is awesome. Battery life is exactly as mentioned in the descriptions. It also shows a battery sign on your phone like this🔋. Delivery is real fast thank to Amazon for that. Calling experience is really good. There is no noise from both the sides during the call. There is no automatically disconnection of calls. Connectivity is the best thing. Airdops connect to your phone as soon as you pick them out of the case after first time pairing process. Charging is really fast. Airdops fits in the ear very smoothly and comfortably..

Reviewed in India on 23 August 2020,william Dudani,Amazon fulfilled products might also be the faulty/defective,I got replaced one against the previous but with the same nois problem in left bud. In left bud It sounds ( like durdarshan tune) bip for some time when ever it connects to the device that is my mobile and it also sounds like that on the starting of any vedio or audio. So after using two different 441 i can surely say that all of the boat ear dops might be defective. And main thing is that this product is fulfilled by amazon. So you can think what the Amazon fulfilled products might be. This product really does not justify the price. You might get it at more lower price but as per me it is not worth at all.,1.0 out of 5 stars

The major problem I faced is the connectivity, the range isnt very strong and you will face issues like choppy and laggy audio when you and your phones are 2 small rooms apart.. 2. Though this isn't a major issue and i faced it only once, sometimes when you use two pods separately there is an audio imbalance. For example, I took out one pod out of the box and decided to use it for 15 mins and then decided to plug in the other one into my ear after 15 mins so the 2nd pod i take out of the box doesn't plays the audio until you keep both the pods in the case close the case and reopen it..

So about this feature..I gotta story to share..all these 3 months I was treating my Airdopes pretty decently but this month I ended up leaving it in my gym shorts pocket & threw it in washing machine 🙄 and only when I realised that it was too late..but hang on once they were getting scrutinised by me assuming that it’s gone & fortunately no it wasn’t gonna die so soon...after a wash sound quality had dimmed for about 15 minutes but then again back to normal..I did that mistake of throwing it again in the washing machine just yesterday too (absent minded me 🙄)..thankfully nothing wrong with them again & it’s good.

Reviewed in India on 19 September 2020,Tee,"Great product! Go for it, this won't disappoint.","I received this 2 days after ordering. Got it on the lightning deal @ 2499. So far, I've been using it for approx 4 hours continuously and haven't faced any problems. Now here's the stuff you are reading this review for :. 1. Fits super snugly in the ears. I've shakwn my head every which way, jumped around, vigorously too, and even fallen asleep with these on. They haven't fallen out even once. Yeah maybe if you get punched in the face they could fall off, but i haven't tested that yet! If you use the right earbud size it will fit better i guess. The earcaps are pretty useless in this regard though. They do nothing. Just use the right earbud size ans push it in properly.. 2. Sound quality is great like you expect from any boat product. The bass is what you bought this for and it won't disappoint. I tested this at both safe and full volumes on my samsung m21 and while the full volume won't make your ears bleed, it's powerful enough to make you uncomfy after 5 minutes. In safe volume state, these are pretty great. Of course i compared these with the brand new boat bassheads 225 i have, and the output from those is louder at the same volume. But that's what i have noticed in a lot of boat products, their bluetooth stuff plays a little softer at the same volume when compared to the regular earphones.. Clarity is otherwise good and everything is balanced. You won't need to tweak with the equaliser unlike what happened with the Boult earphones I've used.. Call quality is pretty decent too. You can hear the person clearly, no problem there. My friend did say that she could hear my voice clearly, though it'd sound better if i was louder, but I'm in general a very loud speaker. So there's that.. 3. Looks pretty decent when worn. The touch controls are a little confusing to gt used to without reading the manual 2 times or more. Of course the touch controls are great, but not too fast. They have some delay.. 4. Charging takes about 1 hour and a bit more. I haven't tested them for how long they can go without another charge so that's next to come.. 5. The case looks super cute though? It's got a matte finish and you get 3 pairs of earbuds and that earcap thing, a charging type C cable and warranty card and manual.. These aside, i can't come up any more points. I hope this review helps.. P. S. : i got the bumblebee yellow.",5.0 out of 5 stars

At this price range they could provide more battery on the buds.. 2. Due to the small size of the drivers the volume is low. You have to keep it at 70% to listen clearly.. 3. The sound is not well balanced, it is shifted more towards the base.. 4. The ears start paining after a long term usage but you will get a hang of it after a while. Also there's an extra fin available which is smaller than the pre installed one so you can switch to it as it's more comfortable (it may depend).. 5.

The battery backup promised to last for at least 5 hours didn't last for more than 3 in actuality.. The delivery was fine & on time though.. I had purchased this product with very high hopes & really didn't wanna give up so requested a replacement which turned out to be worse than the first one.

One of the airpods kept blinking & the other didn't ever stir. The battery backup wasn't great either. The case looked terribly brittle & in a precarious condition & position. The right airdope kept functioning independently of the left one which was really annoying.. Completely frustrated, I spoke to Amazon for a replacement to which they denied & said that only a return was possible & it was really off putting since that meant a loss of discount received for me. Now I would have to pay approximately ₹250 to buy the same product (although I'm never gonna go that). The Amazon team kept repeating their unmeant & unfelt apologies & assured me that a technical team would contact me within 24 hours & a swift redressal of my issues would be effected. However nothing happened & I was ultimately forced to return it at a loss of 10%.. The sound quality is not up to the mark, there is no noise cancellation whatsoever, active or passive, the airdopes hurt your earlobes & are prone to falling off, no matter how much they assure you otherwise.

I would say that the bass is not too high as per my previous experience with boat. It's nicely tuned. The lows are nice than they used to be. The high pitch notes are little bassy when you tune your volume little high.. 2) Calls: Works well for most telephone/whatsapp calls. When I use this for online calls with video conference like Google Meet, the audio starts to crack. I don't think it's a connection issue as I have a pretty fast connection for a household. So the issue could be with the earphones itself. Other than that I don't have any issue with this.. 3) Charge: Looks decent as of now. On 90% I roughly use it for an hour or two and see that I will have some where around 50-60% left. I haven't tested the full single charge test nor the entire capacity of the charging case as I don't use it continuously. Will update once done.. Final verdict. Decent buy as I got it for Rs:1800.

I have been using this products since 5years still I loved the products.. and I am telling you something important here.. Few are telling the product has issues, damaged too early or something else.. see when we buy a product the company will give user manual to tell u how to use it properly did you people read that? Ofcourse more than 90% will not read the manual.. you should.. tell me that what charger you are using to charge the product? you simply say Your mobile charger, do you think that company will give cable to u because of you don't have? No perfectly not, see when u read user manual you will know how to use the product, how to charge the product etc.. in this airdopes we got a cable, and case right in user manual they mentioned that 5V/2A adapter and cable to be used.. that they give cable because of they designed the cable that perfectly fits to the product if you use any other charger or cable to charge the product, that products obsolutely got damaged because of power supply is high see 500mah battery if use high supply cable the product will damage surely, so need attention for that.. and for battery backup you need to charge some extra time after charging got 100% for the first time... One more thing amazon don't give any promise on warranty that they will.. but from the manufacturer they do.. if you have any problem with any product you buy online.. if it's damaged later 7days or 1month or more.. you should go to official website of the product and register your problem they will come to u and solve your problem after 7days of return period amazon will not involve any problem for the product... So please understand.. AI have bought 4ear phones from boat and one is damaged later 1month then I go to boat service online registered with invoice number and they come where they delivered my product and took them to the manufacturer and checked the product then they give me new one replacing the product these will happen within 15days of time period as they promise.. So don't blame the manufacturer, just read the user manual they will tell you what to use what not to do.. how to use the product also learn to read user manual sometimes product got damaged because we don't use them properly... Very less cases there will be manufacturer damages.. so here I am mentioning my product review. 1. We can use it in Call that is good there is a noise cancellation also.. 2.Sound Quality is Good. 3.

Noise cancellation doesn't really deserve a mention. It feels like you've got a pair of rubber tip buds in your ear. That's about it. The mics are too sensitive to the point of being almost unusable for a lot of calls unless you're in a windowless room and nowhere near a spinning fan. The touch sensitive buttons are overly sensitive and the response is extremely delayed to the point of annoyance. I'd tap the button and wait for a good whole second to know whether my music is about to be paused or not. Also, the bluetooth range is a joke once you leave the room without your phone.. Fortunately, I didn't expect a lot from 2000 rupee earphones. I just needed a pair of buds that would give me some ambient music when I'm on the move and wouldn't fall out of my ears easily. The Airdopes 441 obtains passing marks for the ambient music once I fixed the EQ. And it obtains 5/5 for a snug fit.

Reviewed in India on 28 October 2020,Chandrasekaran R.,Not a good option for iPhone user. Even after replacement it didn't work.,"Hi, I am really not a big fan of writing reviews in any e-commerce websites. But after spent lots of time & search I thought I can buy this TWS which comes under my budget. Opened this TWS package with a lot of excitement. Oops... To be frank I am not disappointed with music. The bass and vocal is very clear. But the problem comes only when you try to voice command. As per the instruction we need to hold for 2 secs for voice command. So when I do this that's it. My iphone completely hangs and I cannot open any apps. It won't access hey siri voice command at all. I have to manually close my phone and have to open again which is really really disappointing. I would have agree if this could happen with some unknown brand TWS. But with boAt I am completely pissed off. So I have returned my item on the very first and asked for replacement hoping that this could work with new item. But it happened again. Hence I decided have to live with this without voice command option.. I used to listen songs during my leisure time. So from sound point of view this is still TWS to buy.

Reviewed in India on 2 November 2020,PAPA,Worth the money,"I am writing this review after 3 weeks of extensive usage.. Design: 4/5. It's small and eartips out of the box are comfortable. It fits perfectly in my ears. The big eartips had better passive noise cancellation. Although the small hooks provided really caused pain in my ears. Eventhough it's made of rubber, it didn't adjust properly or simply was not made for my ear. But it's removable so I bid goodbye to that ear hooks and now no pain at all.. Sound quality: 4/5. It's fairly great. Bass is decent, treble and highs and lows arr balanced. No noticeable distortion at high volume too. But if you are a gamer and you need to hear footsteps to play, you will be disappointed with any other TWS at this price range, let alone this one. Because it has a significant amount of latency. So not recommended for gaming.. Battery: 4/5. I listen my songs and watch videos all at 100% volume at all times. So at a stretch the earphones lasted me around 4 hours straight. And with the box, considering I use the earphones for approximately 4 to 5 hours a day, the charge in the case lasted me for an entire week until I had to recharge it again. It has almost become a routine that I have to charge it in every Mondays.. Misc: 3.5/5. Considering sweat proof feature, it's fairly decent. It withstood my daily workouts and cardio. And the CTC is extremely sensitive. It responds to even minute accidental touches. And when I lie down, the accidental touch by the pillow causes it to pause my song. Although over a week of usage, I got used to it and so would you.. And the connectivity is very good. You switch the Bluetooth on on your phone, and then open the box and it will get connected ( for the very 1st time of usage, you need to connect it manually) automatically. And the range is also decent. I leave my phone charging at one room and I wander around my house still it doesn't get disconnected.. And there's one issue with the earphones. There is some kind of static noise in few apps. For me it happened while playing COC. It's low in volume but still noticeable, and at times annoying but I am used to it now. This issue and the fact that I had to remove the rubber earhooks to be comfortable are the only noticeable cons to this TWS to me.. Conclusion: Overall a very good product. It's my first body product and tbh I am not disappointed. It's an all-rounder. Good sound quality, decent battery, good design. I don't know about other TWS at this range but according to me, for 2k it's pretty much worth the money.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Personally it hurts my ears after long use sometimes but that can be a personal issue and insie it has different sizes of buds and the other ring thingy so you can adjust as per your comfort.

The sound quality here is really good. Although I gave a 4 star, cause there's always room for improvement.. 2. There's no complaint about battery. Once paired, the bluetooth earphones run continuously for 5-6 hours without any hassle (less time for music and more for calling feature). Also, once completely drained, the fully charged case can charge the earphones 100% in just a matter of minutes. And due to type-C charging, the case doesn't take much time to charge as well.. 3. Poor bass, only 2 star for that. But then be realistic, such a small item cannot provide you higher bass. If you prefer bass more than anything, do not havr high hopes while buying this item. For me, the bass is perfect.. 4. Noise cancellation is pretty good. I often get chappal from my mom for not listening to her at all. Helps you go through boring lectures as well.. 5. Sometimes, there's a minor connectivity issue. I don't really know why this is happening, but it usually doesn't bother me much cause it gets solved by putting the earphones in the case.",5.0 out of 5 stars

There is a kind of passive noise cancellation due to the in-ear design and it works a bit.. Don't know about the battery life. Later, I might give an edit to this section after using it..

I had to increase mic volume on my laptop for them to work better!!. I also found out another thing. While there is a mic on both the earbuds, only one of them works at a time. And the one working is the one that you picked out first from the box. So keep that in mind. This is not mentioned in the manual.

Full charge will give around 3 hours of music.. - Quality of plastic okay but one should not buy if priced more than Rs 2000 and if willing to bear with the pathetic customer service in case you face issues even if product is in warranty period... Cons:. - After a month of use the left side ear phone sound has decreased significantly which means that the volume of sound is different from right and left side. This cannot be fixed even after factory reset.. - After 3 months of usage the right side earphone sound completely stopped and not working anymore.. - Worst service center who tell me that since my model is new they don't have spare parts ones to replace or fix the earphones even though the product is under warranty. The answer is sorry even in warranty product cannot be fixed be fixed/replaced as they don's support this model since it is a recent model.. - Any emails to official email address provided in Boat website is never acknowledged or replied back.. - Customer care does allow you to proceed without a complaint number and local service center are not willing to accept a complaint.. - Zero noise cancellation. Putting cotton in your ears will block noise better than boAt airdopes 441 pro. Don't get fooled by noise cancelling used for advertising the product.. - The grip in the ears buds does not hold properly and it will fall down frequently if you walk while listening to music. Only good to listen sitting at one place.. - You have to switch on phone Bluetooth before opening the case to connect automatically. In case you open the case and later switch on phone Bluetooth it takes multiple manual attempts to connect.. - The Bluetooth connectivity starts breaking if one goes more than 10-12 feet away from phone.. - Some or the other issues keeps popping time and again therefore factory reset is needed every 2-3 days of usage to fix issues.,1.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 1 January 2021,Richa ,Don’t buy.Left earbud stopped working within a month.,I have been a boat user from past couple years and have got multiple boat accessories but these airdopes disappointed me a lot. The left earbud stopped working even before a month all the money down the drain. I seriously did not expected this from boat.I would definitely recommend boat but not this specific product. I wanted to claim the warranty but for that I need to visit some weird place to get it fixed up. This process is so disappointing I expect so much better from boat atleast a way where I do not have to physically go out in this COVID situation and waste my time on getting this fixed up it should be the responsibility on the vendors end rather than the customer.

Reviewed in India on 25 September 2020,Rudransh Pokhriyal,Terrific purchase but 3 things to notice,After using these airdopes for around 3 months i am writing this review and i must saw it is an another awesome product with a good price as always. .I bought it in a sale and got it for 2500. Sound quality is awesome and bass quality too is terrific.If you talk about noise cancellation it is also very good in terms of other products in this price range.. There are three issues(major or minor you decide on your own)-:. 1. Battery life for each earbud is low as they comes with a small battery and case gives them 4 charges as said by company but the battery life of each of them is just 4-4 and half hours with continous usage with volume 60%-70%.. 2.This might not be an issue for people who only just loves bass but these airdopes are pre configured by company to give maxx output in terms bass this means that vocals are little suppresed by bass all the time and you want vocals to be good and bass less then there is an option but it depends on device i.e by using equalizer. 3.I think this is a major issue that there are no touch controls for adjusting volume of airdopes and it is set to 100% everytime you start them for laptops it is always set to 100% when i connect them but in smartphones android normalizes the volume to 40%. And if you are planning to use with smart tv then forget about it as there no controls on buds for volume and most of the smart TVs don't support volume adjustment of bluetooth devices from them.. Thank you for giving it a reading and i would be very happy to help fellow buyers.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 10 August 2020,Amazon Customer,Worst noise cancellation ever,I was using Boat Rockers 255 for long time and have a lot of commuting on two wheeler due to my work profile.. They were the best thing in my life. Each year December I would get 1 new pair and give away the old pair to my office staff members. This year sadly right ear piece sotopped working. So I decided to upgrade from 255 to 441 true wireless. Have used them for not more than 6 hrs... In which I got 6 to 7 calls during commute. Each person had only one response.... Please remove the Bluetooth and talk over the phone.... So.... I had to stop on the side of the road each time to be able to talk to my clients/family/friends.... Which clearly looses the first point of using a Bluetooth on the go.. P.S I ordered 1st pair on Prime day sale day 1. & In 2 hrs approximately the price of the Bluetooth decreased from 2499 to 1999.... Which is a staggering 500 INR. So I cancelled the order and purchased again in the new deal..
