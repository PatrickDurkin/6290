  Phone was supposedly Unlocked. Worked for a year but now trying to switch carriers the phone has been locked by KDDI Japan. Likely due to the phone being stolen and jail token or something shady. No way to use the phone with my new carrier!! Had to waste so much money due to being swindled by this seller!

  Looks brand new.I purchased the phone and then became skeptical when I seen the very few bad reviews.My own personal experience was flawless, I received the iPhone x a day early (Tuesday)which it was due on Wednesday after I ordered it Saturday.Took it to my carrier of choice which is boost mobile who I have been with for atleast 4-5 years. iPhone x was activated with no problem. I was in and out in about 10 minutes. Definitely a great buy. Next phone will definitely be purchased from here.

  Pos falsely advertised phone. DO NOT BUY. Turned on the phone and it hadn’t been reset and the screen wasn’t receiving touch in certain places. I reset the phone hoping it was a software glitch and nothing changed. I’m locked out of the phone now because I can’t enter the passcode set because the screen won’t accept my inputs when I try to hit the 3.If I would have read the reviews before buying this phone, I wouldn’t of bought it. Seems like half the people who order these phones have major problems...

  I purchased this phone and it arrived looking good as new. At first everything seemed to be functioning great but after just a day or two of light use ( I was still primarily functioning with my previous phone) It started glitching random opening and closing out of apps and doing commands within apps without me even touching the screen. Really wanted this product to be great but I didn't want to pay 500+ dollars for a phone that started off broken.

  So I was really worried after seeing some reviews. I was so close to canceling my order after I’d placed it because I was worried. But I’m typing this out right now on my new iPhone X and I have had absolutely no issues or problems. It works great, the battery life was at 94 capacity, no scratches at all. Clean. Honestly, I was so riddled with anxiety, but I was worrying for nothing. I know everyone’s experiences are different, but mine was amazing. I encourage anyone to buy from this seller.

  The phone is in excellent condition, I’m just slightly disappointed at the battery life and how it’s recommended that I get it serviced because even when it is fully charged, it’s is only running at 79%. So if I am supposed to have 16 hours of battery life, I only have about 12 and a half hours!

  First of all, It arrived earlier than I expected, and they made sure the item was headed in our hands instead of leaving it at the door. Good service! Secondly and importantly, the phone works very well, the battery life of it is at 89% which is more than acceptable. However, there are some scratches on the screen and the side but it's just a little bit, it doesn't bother me much when I operate the phone. Overall, I'd give it 10/10! Thank you Amazon renew!

I wasn't gonna return it considering i did like the product but i thought about the problems it'd bring me down the line. I'm kind of sad but I'm just gonna go ahead and return to get a new and unused iPhone. Of course my experience could be different from others.

So i had to remove it & install a new one. Other than that everything was perfect (so far)

  Please do not hesitate buying it used! Just like you, I was worried about the cosmetic condition, but alas, it came in and looked BRAND NEW! I’ve had it for about a month now and everything works flawlessly. The only gripe I have is the battery life is at 87%. Other than that, this phone is in perfect condition.

  the Screen had little to none scratches and the batter life was at 93% which isn’t bad for a refurbished phone! They even throw in a charger! Definitely worth the money and my phone did come unlocked for any carrier. Was skeptical at first but I’m glad I bought the phone. Looks as if I just bought it from Apple

  This phone is in spectacular condition i was really skeptical about buying a phone off here but I’m glad i did it’s basically in mint condition. No even a scuff mark. Only bad thing is i wish my battery life was a bit higher but at 86% it’s no deal breaker. Definitely am happy with my purchase.

  Ever since I got the phone I've been experiencing a few malfunctions with the screen but it got to the point where half of it wouldn't work. I need to lock and unlock the phone constantly to make it work properly and sometimes that wouldn't even do.Considering the money I have to spend on fixing it I can tell that this was not the worthiest purchase.

There are couple minor issues such as scratches on the top right side screen, and got the phone covered on dust, which gave an impression of a used phone.

  I purchased this phone because I thought it would be a cheap (ish) way to upgrade my phone. I was wrong. After transferring my data and SIM card from my old phone to this phone, it never fully activated because the phone was not fully unlocked as advertised so I never gained LTE/cell service. I went to Verizon and they see it all the time. I spent 2 hours at Verizon trying to undo the damage and get a new (working) phone. Save yourself the headache. Buy a phone new or one from your carrier.

The phone all around is a really good device and my battery health was at 92.

  First, it shipped super fast. It was supposed take about 6 days to arrive and it arrived in 2 days. And it came with a plexiglass screen protector already placed on. I was pleasantly surprised! There are no damages that I can spot and it came almost fully charged. I was able to plug it in and restore my last back up from my 6s plus very quickly. Installing my sim card was easy as well because it came with a little tool specifically for opening the slot. There was a charger and wall piece provided as well. Not an apple brand charger but a charger non the less. Everything seems to be running smoothly and I’m very happy with my purchase. The iPhone X is a great phone. I love the camera quality and the facial recognition. Not having a home button was weird at first but now it’s just second nature and actually makes the interface feel more smooth. I have not had any problems so far. Great price for a product you can’t even tell is refurbished!

  Last Update 7/24/20: Worst purchase I've had on Amazon. The phone restarting is a constant problem. I restart my phone so much in a day i've lost count at this point. I had to purchase a brand new phone because of how annoyed of this phone I am. The glitching was so bad there were points where I couldn't even slide the bar to turn the power off to the phone. I began to use the camera more and guess what, THE CAMERA GLITCHED AS WELL. huge disappointment  Lesson learned, NEVER BUY A RENEWED PHONE EVER AGAIN.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 6/19/20: I HATE THIS PHONE. The screen glitches are become a bigger problem. Constantly having to restart my phone everyday. Its only 11 a.m. and i've already restarted my phone 5 times! The audio on this phone is also horrible. It sounds like a cheap speaker.  I would rate this -0000000 if I could. Save your $$$$$------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I should have listened to the reviews of this phone. The touch screen on this phone is horrible. I restart my phone literally at least once a day because the touch screen randomly stops working. Sometimes the phone starts glitching and exists me off apps, etc. Since getting this phone I’ve been getting emails about someone trying to login to my email from the other side of the world which is pretty weird since that’s never happened to me before getting this phone. In general I DO NOT recommend and I would definitely get a refund if I could.

  Item had a lot of scratches to begin with but I understand it’s a refurbished phone. but after a few days phone stopped reading the SIM card and it was suppose to be an unlocked phone.  Guys spend a lil more and have piece of mind that your phone will work .  Replacement was sent and was even worse than the old phone. Again it was sprint phone with a sprint SIM card already in it which probably belong to the person who had it before me.  Just get a new phone even if it’s an older model.  What a disgrace.

  Okay so off the start i went to check the maximum capacity of the battery and it was already at 85%. Face recognition barely works half the time and has to be reset a couple of times to work. Half the time it’s just better to just put in the password instead of looking like an idiot trying to get it to work. Get your iPhone from somewhere else because this place just let me down.

  I took a gamble ordering this phone I wasn't feeling the negative reviews but the positive reviews outshine the negative. I was prepared when opening my package so I recorded myself doing so in case something went wrong during transit but it was in good condition and looks brand new. facial rec. doesn't always catch on the first try but oh well I gave 4 stars cause of that. battery was at 73 when I figured out how to check it idk what percentage it goes up or if it dies down as you use it usually it charges 100% with my other phones but I'm charging in hopes it charges to higher percentage. not too sure why they ask me to rate battery life. but 4 stars is good enough. id put 5 stars if it charged 100% obviously. overall its worth the money for me you have my approval. gang

  The phone arrived almost overnight and in excellent, sturdy packaging. The phone is great except the screen was definitely used. I guess that makes sense... it is used. It had a few scratches and I just noticed there is a tiny chip in the side of the screen - but it is not noticeable. I am guessing the seller did not even notice.Anyway great phone and I'd still recommend getting a phone from this guy rather than buying one new.

  Well, it’s been 10 days and my phone screen has started cracking along the edges. The screen is aftermarket and clearly this seller uses the cheapest glass possible. Phone was never dropped once. Has no body damage. Also wasn’t too pleased that my battery has under 80% life as well.I’m hoping the seller has a solution for me. Be careful buying from him.

  GREAT PHONE!!! Seeing the few negative reviews, I was a little worried about getting this phone but so far It’s working amazingly! I will say that it had a few scratches on the sides but not noticeable. The screen works perfectly fine, the battery life is a little eh but it’s to be expected from a refurbished phone. Other than that its perfect and I highly recommend it<U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC> The delivery was fast and came sooner than the expected time.

  In all honesty this is a huge upgrade from the phone I already had, the battery life is awesome...touch screen works great, the phone overall works wonderfully.The only thing that I’d really complain about is all the scratches on the side of the phone and the small crack the phone screen has. It’s very tiny, so I wasn’t THAT bothered by it...but other than that the phone is fine.

  My iPhone 5S performance was deteriorating and I decided to upgrade by getting this phone. I have Straight Talk by TracFone Inc. a GSM carrier, and received a refurbished iPhone X that was from Verizon and was able to insert my SIM card without any interruption of service. The only noticeable wear and tear on the iPhone I received was some marks that are barely noticeable on the touchscreen. Hopefully this helps anyone trying to decide if they should purchase this phone.

  The phone came in a simple box, with the cord and white charging adapter box.FYI cannot use any other charging adapter with this phone.The phone condition is excellent. Came with IOS 12 and had to update to the 13.*.* right away.Set up was amazingly effortless from android to the iPhone with the proper apps installed on the android.Had to call my carrier to add the phone to my account so it would work properly.  FYI my carrier requires unlimited DATA for the iPhone X.The phone reception (connection to the cell towers an gsm is amazing).  It is better than my daughters iPhone X max.Have not tried the fingerprint reader yet.Face recognition works well no issues so far except in low light situations.  Guess that is to be expected.The battery had a 30% charge when arrived.  It charged to 100% and worked well until it died 24 hours later.  It tends to get hot when using Bluetooth.  Will reach out and see if this is supposed to be happening.  Had an android blow up on me for over heating.Update:No home spot or finger prints reader on the phone.Also the iPhone X works well with my CGM from Lifestyle LibreLink 14 days sensors.Over all for the price I give it my approval.

  I was very skeptical about buying a refurbished phone but couldn’t afford the price tag of a new phone and my very old iPhone 6s was on its last leg. The phone arrived a day early and I was shocked there wasn’t a scratch on it. So far, I’ve had zero problems transferring everything. Battery arrived at 98% (when I checked) so I’m Sure it was 100%. Not sure how to get old Sim so I’m going to Verizon for that. Apple gave me a new Sim a while back when I knew my phone was starting to die. I’m sure Verizon can figure out what to do. I’m confident this is my issue and not seller’s. If problem arises, I’ll update.

  It came in a plain white box with a functional charger (not original) and no headphones. The phone was covered with a clear plastic and had really minor scuffs (barely noticeable, I used a bright white light to search for scratches) at the base of the phone around the speaker and charging port. I would describe the appearance as excellent.No issues with setup. I tested camera, video call, video recording, phone call, touch screen and Bluetooth connectivity to fitbit, speakers and car. Everything worked fine. Works like a new phone. Battery health is at 84% (I wish it was over 95%) but it works much better than my old iPhone and I'll replace the battery in time if it does not hold charge. It got a bit hot while using it which I'll assume had to do with the phone consuming a lot of data from the installation and setup process.This phone was purchased for use in Trinidad & Tobago on bmobile network. It connected easily without an issues therefore the phone is unlocked as stated. This was my first 24 hours with the phone and I'm very pleased with this renewed purchase. Synergy was the only seller that I found with little negative reviews and I am glad and feel relief that I chose this seller.If there are any issues within the next few weeks, I'll update this review.Update April 2020: With regular FaceTime use I realised that that is a minor flaw with the camera. The screen has intermittent black flashes that last for a second. I've noticed it and the person on the other end of the call noticed it. Other than that, the phone works as described.

  I purchased a Premium Renewed iPhone X. The item arrived in a shrink-wrapped Renewed branded box. There was a lot of information inside to help me understand more about the Amazon Renewed Guarantee which allows me to return this Premium item for up to one year if anything goes wrong. I've had the phone for two weeks now and love it. It might as well have been a brand new phone. Battery health is 100%. The camera is incredible (a BIG step up from my old 6S). I highly recommend this!

  This phone came in great condition! The battery is at 89% but I can’t complain since this is a renewed item. The screen has no cracks neither the back.. I did checked the edges and there was no scratches at all!!camera works 100% and fully worked with my carrier! Bought it from chubbiestech and will buy again! It came with a free screen protector!Edit* This phone is still up and running smoothly after a couple of months!! just buy it

My phone came with a case a charger a charging brick and a screen protector plus a sim removed tool.

It actually came with a screen protector so I will be returning the one I purchased with the phone.  I was also able to easily switch carriers due to the fact that it is unlocked.

  Great phone, almost no signs of use beforehand. Came with a screen protector on it, the screen protector has the tiniest little scuff on the screen but you barely notice it, and it’s on the protector and not the phone so I could care less. Phone works great, purposefully waited about a week to write a review to ensure everything stayed good. Great buy.

This isn’t a big deal for me since I expect that with a refurb phone. Everything else works perfect and it came looking brand new.

  The phone came with a preinstalled screen protector, which was neat, and had fade scratches on the back. The stainless steel on the sides has a decent amount of scuffs, which is predictable for its price. But the phone functionality is great judging by the 100% battery life which I am amazed with. All in all it’s a pretty decent purchase.

  The phone came pretty quickly. I ordered it on a Tuesday this week and today is Saturday and I just received my phone. It came dent and scratch free loved that part. Doesn’t come with headphones but most refurbished devices don’t so I’m not mad at that it does however  come with a charger. All and all my first experience buying a refurbished device from amazon was actually pretty decent and cool the wait wasn’t long , I saved $345 by buying here instead of with my phone company, I also found some great deals on cases if I ever needed to use it again I definitely would.

Very good condition, so far no problems. 10/10 recommend, just read the description and see if it actually has your carrier.

  When I opened the box, the phone was in pristine condition! The only thing I noticed so far is that there is a long micro scratch at the bottom, but after an hour of using it I noticed it, so I’m not bothered by it. Other than that, it looks and performs great! Don’t let the low star reviews scare you, bedsides, you can return it or get a refund if you’re not satisfied with it. No risks!

  El teléfono funciona perfectamente, actualmente estoy en Colombia y el teléfono funciona muy bien, pude hacer el registro con Movistar (mi operador) y funciona muy bien. Sin embargo, el apartado estético del teléfono fue decepcionante. No es como dice en Amazon Renewed “luce como nuevo” el celular se bastante que ha sido usado, tiene marcas de rayas que le dejó un estuche y una peladura en uno de los laterales. Desafortunadamente vivo muy lejos (en Colombia) como para solicitar un cambio, así que tuve que quedarme con el teléfono pero no estoy totalmente satisfecho.

  I ordered this phone about a month ago and had to send it back because it wouldn't turn on and the audio was broken (which Apple told me when they inspected it). Then I was sent another one by Hybrid it and it has been working. However, the phone audio doesn't work. I thought at first it was just me and I couldn't hear the music well but then I compared it to the audio on my old phone and realized it is broken. I can have the music play at maximum volume and I still won't be able to hear it.

  I purchased a “renewed” iPhone X. The phone does not charge to its fullest capacity. The phone gets hot when it’s on too long. And my biggest issue is that the apps from previous owner is burned onto the screen. I was finally able to get a quote from the Apple Store to fix the issue which would cost about $125-$175.I contacted the seller and they offered me $20 and I would have to pay for the rest of the repair. My other option was to exchange for another phone.  After all the back and forth now I would have to wait a week or so for a replacement from a company who mailed me a damaged phone to begin with? Or $20 to put towards the repair of a phone I just bought? This seller has poor customer service and a lack of internal communication. Save your hard earned money and buy from someone else.

  All the features of the phone work great, battery life is great, runs basically brand new. However the charging port is having issues (with supplied Lighting cable and old cable I had.) Luckily it has wireless charging so it's not the end of the world. But that's the only things keeping this from being 5/5. Also might not be ""waterproof"" anymore if this phone was open before.

  Wow ..I was really thinking this phone would show up and looking used .. but I was wrong!!It was in super great shape, no scratches or wear on it at all . The only sign of use was the very fine wear on the silver metal outside trim - which is covered by my new phone case anyways, right !!!!Silly me, I ordered the iPhone X, which is actually slightly smaller than the iPhone 8+, that I was upgrading from, but upon closer examination... I noticed that the screen is actually slightly longer than the iPhone 8 plus and just barely smaller screen when you consider the fact that it’s from edge to edge design and no longer has the action button in the middle.I really love the new feature of face recognition that saves me so much time and is very convenient at work knowing... apps just open so easy now & knowing  that no one can steal my phone, or pick it up and get information that is vital personal information on credit cards and such. There are just too many new features to name them all but it is definitely an upgrade from an 8+!!!It did take me a few days to get used to the phone, & how different this phone is overall, the Touch screen is just very different ...& because I’m just not a very techy person...but I caught on really fast within three days I was in love with the phone<U+0001F60D>I would highly recommend buying from this seller, definitely worth saving the <U+0001F4B0> <U+0001F4B4>

  Bought for my fiancé for Christmas and she loves it. She has had literally 0 problems with it. Everything works perfect and battery life is like new. I spent a lot of time researching what was the best option on Amazon for a newer phone with 256gb and this was an awesome choice. I read a lot about other fully unlocked phones not working with Verizon or other carriers as well as other complaints. There was only one other review when I bought this but it was 5 stars. Would DEFINITELY buy again.

  I ordered the phone and it worked well for a few months until it started the dreaded “ghost touch”. I took it to the apple store as they have a program to fix it for free as it is a known hardware issue. They would not fix it for less than $279 because there were third party parts. I contacted the seller (within the 90 days) to find out the next steps and they suggested a few rests to “fix” the problem. By the time I did the “fixes” and the ghost touch came back, I was told it was too late to return and now I am stuck with a phone that types and changes screen on its own. Needless to say I am unhappy with this customer service as it is clearly spa defect that is known and that I had nothing to do with and it is being held to some ridiculous warranty although it was brought to the attention of the seller before hand. I can’t help but feel like I have been duped. The cosmetic parts of the phone were great, it’s the hardware that is the issue.

  My daughter had dropped my phone from not even a 1 ft. fall and the screen itself popped off of the actual phone! The screen continued to work without being entirely on the phone, and hanging by a wire. I had tried to simply pop the screen back on but then the whole thing turned black and I wasn't able to see anything but I was still able to fell vibrating from notifications. I went to get it fixed the day after and come to find out the screen that was on there wasn't even the original screen, and on top of that the person who did put the last screen on put it on wrong resulting in the screen coming off. In my opinion, the fact that the screen WASN'T the original, it should've been stated in the description. And I also wasn't able to use my iCloud due to ""not enough storage"". But my other phone was only a 16GB and I still had space to give. Other than that everything else works fine.

  Bought a Iphone from this company and what a big mistake.  First off I knew the phone was refurbished, not an issue.  The 1st month the phone worked fine after the 30 days were up the phone started freezing and not working properly.  I though this was pretty normal being that the phone was refurbished.  After about 45 days the phone stopped working.  I took it to a local repair shop and to my surprise all the parts that they used to refurbish the phone were from other phones other than Apple.  I then contacted the seller who offered to replace the phone.  Since then there has been no communication from him, doesn't return calls or e-mails and i'm sitting here with a phone that does not work.

  This purchase was amazing! The phone came with a screen protector (which you are supposed to remove), it was completely unscratched and undamaged, it turned on like a factory Apple phone with the white screen that says Hello and stuff. It's been a few weeks and the phone works perfectly (sound, screen, facial recognition and all). I bought it with the All Carriers option and it let me hook it up to any Carrier afterwards. Definitely would buy a phone from this company again!

Came with a cable, a wall USB outlet, and the little tool for popping out the sim card holder.  So far this phone has been perfect and I'm very happy with it.  The battery is holding a charge well, everything works, and it appears un-used.

  I purchased a refurbished iPhone x, it arrived on time, came in clean , and with a charger.... i was excited about this phone because my other phone was stolen 3 months ago, i got a job and saved up to be able to afford a new one. We tried to set up the service with total wireless and the phone kept repeating the message that the sim card was not compatible.... so we bought another sim card and service plan by t mobile and got the same thing.... went into apple the next day to try to see if their was anything wrong with the phone... turns out their was nothing wrong with the phone, but the phone already had another service plan with at&t that wasn't even payed off.... so after wasting 10 hours off my time, and spending $60 (besides the $690 phone price)  trying to set this stupid phone up with a service plan... i would review this 0 stars if i could

  This IPhone X has been phenomenal. The speed at which it operates is Incredible. If you are questioning this buy, don’t. It’s a wonderful deal. I’ve not had one issue thus far, and will most certainly update this review if I have one within the warranty period. I recommend getting a tempered glass screen and a good case—this phone is glass front and back.

  I was very skeptical when ordering this product because of the negative reviews, but this was MORE than worth the money. Had no scratches or anything. Worst thing I found was cosmetic wear on the edges (in the picture uploaded). Battery is at 92% capacity and it works like a dream. Only minor inconvenience was having to update the phone before I could download the backup from my old phone. Came fully unlocked as promised and with an off brand charger that works fine.

  While the phone looked perfect and seemed as if it functioned well, it would not connect to  carrier that it says it is made for- Verizon, despite being advertised as being unlocked for Verizon Service. I have a traditional monthly (NOT a pay as you go account). I was very disappointed. The only option offered was to return it for a refund. I have sent the seller a message and requested they send me a replacement device. That is a shame. :( For those who question my knowledge, I took it directly to Verizon and they also tried multiple sim cards in it and none worked. The phone continued to display NO SERVICE. They went through all of the normal fixes and could not get it to function properly. I will update this review if a MIRACLE occurs and I am suddenly able to get service.

  So before I made this purchase, I read through a lot of reviews on a lot of different sellers who had iPhone X's for sale. This one seemed to have the most consistent positive stream of reviews, although every single listing I came across had at least a few people reporting bad experiences. Buying something Amazon Renewed seems like it's always a risk, so I suppose you may have a bad experience, but the phone I received came on time, and was essentially in flawless condition. It came with a tempered glass screen protector already on, and the battery health was at 92%, supporting peak performance capabilities. The cameras are crisp, no damage to them at all, and the speakers sound great. No SIM/WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity issues whatsoever, and really I was pleasantly surprised at how great this phone is. The only thing was that in a couple of the crevices on the phone, chiefly around the camera's protrusion, there was a tiny bit of dirt/grime, but a toothpick and alcohol did the trick. Overall I would say this is a great purchase, as iPhone X's are currently going for $899+tax (new) from Best Buy, and this was almost new for $559+tax (~$611). Would recommend!

  LOVE! THOUSAND TIMES LOVE! I was skeptical at first when selecting to buy this iPhone, I took time into reading all the comments and seeing as there was more positive reviews then negatives I went ahead and bought it. The entire phone is in BRAND NEW condition, no scratches or blemishes! The battery life was said to be 80% mine on this phone is 99% maximum capacity! I am very pleased with how well this turned out to be! I did however not rate the fingerprint ID because it is facial ID not fingerprint.I do recommend trying not to go through FedEx as they are crap.

  Ordered a 256 GB for AT&T. Product came with minor scuffs on the sides of the phone that were easily covered by a cheap case. IMEI was clean and I just slid in the SIM card from my old iPhone to get signal. Battery life was at 85%. Solid 8/10 quality but well worth the discount over buying new. Will update if any issues arise.

But I can barely hear the person on the other line. The other person can hear me well. Turns out the earpiece speaker was just super dusty. I cleaned for days and now I'm really happy with this purchase.

  I’ve bought plenty refurbished phones/renewed phones, usually that means a used phone with a new front glass. To my pleasant surprise both sides of the glass appear to be new.  But I was extremely surprised to see a 100% life battery. The stainless steel casings by Apple are very durable in comparison to their aluminum no damage as expected. Of course I wouldn’t bet on receiving an essentially new phone but that what I got.

  I just got this phone 5 days ago, and on the second day already, it won't charge past 2%, and then it dies. I took it on a trip and was barely able to use it. Good thing I brought my old cracked phone with, otherwise I wouldn't have a phone at all. I tried charging it for hours and it would just repeat the cycle of turning on up until 2%, and then dying again. Super disappointing because it is a cute phone.P.s I tried 3 different chargers and the result was the same.

I went into Sprint to get my amazing new phone set up, and once I got there they said it wasn't compatible with Sprint. I guess I thought ""fully unlocked"" meant compatible with any carrier, but I was wrong. The IMEI number to this phone was not compatible with my carrier and there was no way to fix it. Sadly I ended up returning it. Overall the phone is in great condition, just be careful about whether or not it is compatible with your carrier.

  This phone was terrible. When I received iphone X today, I found the camera was broken. While using camera app, I see some black cracks on the screen. I guess the inner camera lens was cracked. In the photo by this phone like above picture, I see black cracks. This phone has a serious defect. I cannot understand how a defective phone was sold. I should cost time and energy for returning the phone.

  I purchased the phone as a gift for my husband. Upon arrival the screen started to give problems. After consulting with an Iphone specialist it was discovered that the screen had to be replaced.  The screen was proven to be defective. I was very disappointed to say the least. The Seller was also not helpful. I was asked to remove my negative feedback and they would try to assist me. They never contacted me after I remove my initial feedback. I had to contact them and after I did they said that the time had passed and they cannot help me.

  Phone came like new with a charger(not the usual apple charger); no scratches on the screen or anywhere else. Screen quality is great, face recognition works perfectly. Only issue I had was when putting my SIM card in it gave me an error message because it couldn’t connect to my carrier network, but I just went to my carrier (t-mobile) and they gave me a newer SIM card, now it works perfectly.Still waiting to see if I have any performance issues overtime but so far so good.

  Phone came in a box where it had no padding, it shipped flopping around in a box that could not firmly contain in. Did not come with a headphone/aux adapter, so that was not cool. Came with a super generic block and cord. Emphasize generic. Probably came off the boat with corona virus. The phone itself is solid and battery is good enough. I’d find a different seller if you want better or more or accessories included.

  I like everything about this phone. It looks great, feels great and it has memory for days which is why I bought it. The only thing NOT new about it is the battery capacity which is 80% (seller guaranteed at least 80% so I'm cool with that). It looks like I'm the first person that touched it so that's amazing. I endorse this seller so go ahead and hit them up. If you don't like it you have 90 days to exchange it or get a refund so you don't have anything to lose. For this price point I must say that I'm impressed with the overall quality. Happy shopping!

The company was very helpful and exchanged the phone for another one, however the replacement had an antenna malfunction and would not connect to WiFi outside of 5 feet from the router. I tried to exchange it again, but they no longer had that model in stock and will be issuing a refund.  I ultimately ended up spending the extra money to buy a new phone directly from Apple.The customer service was great, the product (both of them) were not, hence 2 stars.

The device will not turn on and I cannot reset the device. CellCow told me that this device is not returnable on the warranty. The warranty is a 90 day return policy and it has been 105 days. 15 days after the policy ended. I have not done anything to the IPhone that would cause this issue. CellCow sold a faulty IPhone and is now refusing to refund or replace the device.

  Beautiful iPhone for $330. I traded it in with my carrier T-Mobile for a $830 credit towards the iPhone 12 Pro Max. They said the previous carrier was Sprint (not T-Mobile as advertised), but since Sprint & T-Mobile have merged this was no big deal. The seller shipped it the same day, but because of one day of bad weather back East, UPS took OVER 2 weeks to deliver it to Los Angeles! This was NOT the sellers fault at all, it was completely the fault of UPS. I was concerned after reading the seller's feedback, but I can report that they did a great job with my transaction!

  Looked like new - no sign of wear.  Battery % compared to new was 84% per the Amazon Renewed sticker on side of box.  Came with charger and screen protector- unfortunately screen protector was for Xr and not the X, so I bought one that fit.  Transferred data from old phone & this “new” X works great.  Much better than paying $700 more for the latest when it’s not necessary.Only downside was getting the shipment hung up 10 days awaiting FedEx transfer to Memphis due to the Feb winter storm.

  Phone was in Pristine condition. Phone worked as expected. This is absolutely a REAL IPHONE X. This is NOT A FAKE. It does not come in a apple box, however it did come with a screen protector and a black silicone case. There was no charger as explained in the description. I only returned it due to it being a little to small of a screen compared to the one my husband has now which is the iphone 7plus. If it would have been for myself I would have absolutely kept it. Picture was amazing, fast as heck too. So I HIGHLY recommend this seller and am willing to say they are trustworthy devices. Seller also replied in a timely manner to answer my question in reference to possibly exchanging it.

If you want it, spend the extra money and get it apple refurbished where they replace the screen, casing and battery.

  Worst experience...do not buy! Four months after purchasing, apps started freezing and every time we attempted to make a call, the phone would reboot and the call would drop.  Contacted Amazon and they contacted the 3rd party vendor (Kiss Electronics) and it went no where since they only back the phone for 3 months.  Spent hours with Apple support and we did a factory reset which was unsuccessful in fixing the problem.  They also did a remote diagnostic check and found no issues?  They said, I could ship the phone to them to have their technicians work on the phone, but the estimate cost for that service was $918...who would ever spend that?  I conclude this ""Kiss Electronics"" knows they are selling garbage and Apple does not want you to fix phones as they would rather see you elect to trade in for a more expensive option.  I guess this is a $400+ lesson to not buy a ""renewed"" phone ever again through Amazon!

   Overall Review———————-10/10 Heres why.I actually returned A iPhone X 256G space grey phone because I ordered the wrong color. I benchmarked it and the silicone is healthy, no physical markings on the outside, charger port is stiff. Speaker holes clean.the only down side is the max knit is lower then a OEM screen (I can confirm all phones ship with this screen for the most part since I have test two phones from this 3rd party)- For those not tech savvy.I can honestly say any product from this person/company is reliable with battery max life sitting around 84%-92%(varies in which phone you get)  which for the price is bang for buck. It cost 2.50 at UPS to return. Hybrid It gave me a full refund including the tax.One week laterI ordered from Hybrid It one more time.I was not disappointed.-unlocked-battery max health 94%-no visible scratchesThe screens white point isn’t as high as OEM(as expected) but should do until you decide to get a OEM Retina displayHope this helps ya’ll.-EasyIsHere

  I needed to purchase a new phone and I am so glad that I ordered this one.  In addition, working with this company was great.  They were very prompt to answer my emails and thoroughly answered my questions.The product I ordered was exactly what I received.  The product description matched what was delivered to me.Even if you have an active SIM card, you will likely have to go to the carrier and have one activated and installed.  I did, but it was not a big deal, a minor detail if you ask me, but I sort of expected that.If I am ever in the market for another cell phone (although I hope it will be quite some time), I would purchase from this company again.I feel like this company is very honest and reliable.I recommend both the product and the seller.Kanga Supply, it  was a pleasure doing business with you.

  Received on time but returned after only two days of trying to use it. The phone was hopping between apps, typing on its own, and wouldn’t allow me to properly transfer my info from the iPhone I had been using at the time.  Also, read the sellers return policy. They will only give you a full refund for certain issue. For instance, an issue like myself but if you change your mind, purchase by accident, or find a lower price ext., you will not get a full refund, only a percent.

   So I've been using this phone for a couple months now since that video was recorded and I can confidently say I am very happy with my purchase. Everything works as expected, the phone was in way better physical condition than I expected. I had an iPhone 6S before this so it was a much needed upgrade without having to spend too much money. Of coruse I can only speak to my experience with this seller and so far I have no complaints and would recommend them to anyone seeking to purchase a refurbished phone.

  I was nervous after some of the bad reviews, but went for it, anyway. I am so glad that I did! I've been using my phone for a few days and it's perfect, like a brand new phone. It also came with a screen protector and 2 decent cases inside the box, it was a nice surprise.

  Envío súper rápido, pero creo que le cambiaron la pantalla ya que la parte superior no es como la de fábrica tiene una curva que no es. Agregaré una foto para mostrar. Es el único detalle, y que la pantalla de un momento a otro con poco brillo se volvió con muy poca tenuidad o contraste. Lo comparé con otro iPhone y se nota. El resto todo bien. Lo traje a Chile y aquí hay que inscribirlo por el imei pero es proceso súper rápido, es obligación inscribirlo para poder usar en redes chilenas, de lo contrario se bloquea a los 30 díasEDIT: Después de 3 meses de uso murió la pantalla, tuve que repararla por mis medios la cual me costó $120.000 clp (150usd).

  Everything about the phone is great! Works like it’s brand new, has some wear and tear but nothing major or noticeable unless you’re looking for it. It came with a phone case and screen protector and I had no idea it was going to. The battery health is 87% so not the best but, better than nothing at all! I put my SIM card it in and switch my number myself online on my carriers site and it started working NO PROBLEM! I’d definitely buy again and recommend to friends and family.

  I had this phone for almost a month and it was working great, but over the weekend, the bottom half of my touchscreen stopped working. I’ve tried doing a forced reset, but can’t get it to work and can’t unlock my phone without being able to press the buttons. I didn’t get it wet or anything. Just stopped working. I have an appointment at an Apple store next weekend and am hoping they can fix it. Otherwise I’m probably going to have to buy another phone.

  Cheap battery; I just had to spend $50 to get a replacement from some other shop. They also said the screen was also of poor quality but I have had no issues there. Silent mode sends my phone to a spasm so it’s forced to be loud.Update: Now the screen has given way and dead pixels as well as the screen gradually becoming all white, dead pixels as I use it although it resets when I lock it. Absolutely no quality control here and I am extremely unsatisfied with this.

   The condition of the phone itself was good, but the phone operations were poor. The touch screen Would not work for the upper half of the phone as you can see in the video. It did this even after completely setting it up after several attempts. Tried To navigate through without the ability to touch the top part of the phone. Could not be done. Returning the device, and saved myself further disappointment.

  I really do love this phone. I’ve had it for a few days now, came in practically PERFECT minus a couple small scratches, but it is refurbished, so I was expecting that. It does lose battery kind of quick, but otherwise, I’m VERY pleased. I love my phone, I love the camera quality, the touch screen works perfect, it came fully unlocked like it said and works with my provider perfectly. It was quick and easy to set up, and the face lock works well too.I really do recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable, but newer phone. I was surprised how new it looked.Thank you so much! I really do love it!-Candace&Andy

  Everything else worked day 1 except for the bottom speaker. The top speaker worked at first, but went out after a week. I have not dropped the phone even once. I can only talk on the phone and hear audio if I have headphones or a Bluetooth device connected. If these are guaranteed like-new, then how does a problem like this get past inspection? Do they just look at the battery health and see if it's more than 80%, nothing more?

Little did I know that this phone would be so good there are no cracks and there are really no scratches except for one tiny little one but with a case you can’t see it. It feels like a brand new phone and I’m glad that I got this $450 phone vs a $850 brand new phone if ur thinking about getting this phone honestly get it cause you won’t regret it

  This sucks. Got the phone for my wife and it has “ghost touches” which pretty much means that the screen recognizes touches that aren’t actually happening and makes the phone go crazy to where it is unusable. This started happening pretty much right after we got the phone and is only getting worse! Just save the money and go buy from an Apple store.

  This iPhone X was purchased to replace a vintage iPhone 6. Free shipping and delivery as promised. The package came  bubble wrapped with no shipping or handling damage. This iPhone X looks like new. It was free of scratches, bumps or bruises. The only thing notable is that the battery only charges to 85%, even through it indicates 100%. It came with a screen protector, SIM card key and a charging cable, also.The X  had  a 60% charge, so startup via the  guided instructions was initiated. There was a bit of drama during the transfer of my backup from the old phone via bluetooth.  I had to reboot the X and switch to iCloud to restore the backup via WiFi.  Once I learned to do that, the data and APPS were on the new X in a few minutes.  Next I removed the SIM from the 6 and installed it in the X. This entire process is doable by anyone who has used a smartphone. You don't need the high pressure sales person and this will save you several hundred $$'s.  Just make sure you get a phone that works on your network; Version, AT&T or whatever.

  My iPhone X came sooner than expected which was awesome. When I opened my package the cell phone was in excellent condition. It looked brand new. Not a single scratch on the front & back of the phone. The seller guaranteed the battery life on his iPhone X sold would be no lower than 80%. When I received my phone the battery life was 89% which was good. I was hoping for someone in the 90s, but 89% is still very good. :)  Overall I’m very happy with my purchase.* I will update my review in about a month to see how the phone is overall after using it normally.

  I lost my original iPhone X in February 2021 in snowy woods (after years of good service). I searched diligently, but never found it. I decided to get another iPhone X rather than 12. I bought the 256GB Space Gray for Verizon (Renewed) through Amazon. It came on time, well packaged, without any physical flaws I could find. I took it to the Verizon store where I bought my original iPhone X. They downloaded/installed my saved data and many apps (for a fee) and (gratis) installed the tempered glass screen protector and case I had also bought from Amazon. After a month of use, I find nothing amiss.  I'm very happy with the entire process.

  I’ve had my iPhone X for a couple of days. The phone came 2 days earlier than expected. Quality of photos is superb! Very minor scratches on the back but overall it’s in wonderful shape.The phone came without a screen protector but I bought one. It was fully unlocked. This is the iPhone X (5.8 screen) A bit smaller than my iPhone 8 Plus but I like how it’s lightweight and fits better in my hand. I’m very pleased. Thank you!

  I’m very happy with my new iPhone X! It works perfectly and was easy to set up. When I got it, the Battery Health was at 83%(Settings>Battery>Battery Health). However, the battery lasts much longer than my previous phone. The box the phone came in was a very sketchy looking generic “Smart Device” box. However, there is nothing generic about the phone! The phone charger it came with was not an official iPhone charger, but still works. Overall, I am pleased with the phone and I’d recommend this to others. The price was hard to beat, even when I was looking on Facebook marketplace. It arrived on time as well.

  I ordered this iPhone X 256GB Oct 3rd & received it Oct 8th & I must say, I read the review after I made the purchase & was extremely nervous lol... Luckily my X had no scratches, battery life is great & all I did was swapped my SIM card from my 7+ & put it in this & BOOM, instant use!!! I’ve yet to have a problem with it... It took maybe 20+ mins to update & I didn’t know how to transfer all my Apple Music over at once & just ended up manually going through all my albums to redownload them (I have over 2,000 songs lol) overall I’m overly satisfied with my purchase!!!!!!

Tengo una pregunta, el envío de este producto tengo yo que pagarlo? me parece injusto, porque voy a tener que pagar envío por algo que me llegó dañado y luego volver a pagar para que me envíen otro de nuevo, en buenas condiciones de funcionamiento. Esto me genera problemas: uno porque no me llegó el celular funcionando bien y segundo porque ahora voy a tener que tener gastos adicionales de envío y luego pagar por el otro pedido también.

  I ordered this phone not expecting too much, but it came with many surprises.1. This phone arrived extremely fast. I don't have prime, and it still arrived in 3 days. Huge plus!!2. The screen and body had minimal scratches. The paint was a bit scratched on the charging port, and there was a few very tiny scratches on the notch, but not on the screen or body itself. Very good.My only problem is the battery health on this phone it came at 88%  That is not too bad, but I would still prefer something higher. I ordered a replacement and I requested that I would prefer something that is 95% or higher. They seemed very understanding, so we will see what will happen. Other than that AMAZING PHONE!!!

  Like some, I was skeptical of a ""Renewed"" product after reading some reviews but the phone is great! No scratches, no dings, no visible damage and everything works perfectly. This is my second time purchasing used tech from Amazon and both times I have been very satisfied. The setup was super easy and I was using my new phone in 10 minutes! I would recommend buying this phone to friends and family.The only thing I would point out was that the max battery life on this device is only 87%. I knew that going into the purchase so it's not a surprise or a concern of mine. Overall, the trade off for battery life is well worth the $$$ that I saved if I were to buy a new phone.

  It came in great shape. I can’t complain about the battery life either - it is a two year old phone, and it was still an upgrade from my iPhone 8 that I had to charge every twenty minutes! My only complaint is the Face ID (spotty sometimes, but I guess it’s learning), and the GPS...Sometimes when Im on GPS and Navigating somewhere (Apple Maps, has always worked fine in the past & on other devices), the map will freeze as if my car is not moving and can no longer pick up my location...You can see why this would cause problems.

I didn’t have any scratches on the glass on the front or back.  The sides are a bit worn out, but that’s to be expected.  I have a case on anyway so I don’t mind the scratches.

Ok so yeah some can argue that it should of been just the phone and a screen protector is proof it was not cleaned completely. Dude whatever it is one piece I don’t have to worry about! 5*

  I was very skeptical when we bought this for my son but it seems after several weeks that the phone is working ok. I guess we will have to wait a bit longer to see that the battery will last.However, I was very disappointed that the phone DID NOT arrive with an original apple charger. The charge that we got is not charging the phone well and looks like will stop working in the near future.

  I liked that it came exactly as it descripted, The quality was brand new and came with a little charger to give it battery life. I was able to create a new itunes account, as well as imessage other iphones, set up find my iphone. It is the ios version that includes the new apps current so I got all the free apps to work on the store, and the camera worked just fine. I was able to use the new live wallpaper video feature and I was able to download my previous bought songs from itunes.

  Phone came in three days from NY to LA. Came packaged in a nice little bubble wrap pouch inside a box. Came with a 10 foot power cord and a charging cube as well. Zero issues with phone or activating. Zero scratches or dirt or fingerprints or anything at all on the phone. Could be brand new. Very satisfied with this purchase. Wife was able to plug it in and restore it from her previous iPhone backup with no problems. Recommended

  After trying to activate a new sims card with an AT&T employee and after providing the IMEI and MEID numbers listed on the phones setting, I found out this phone had $526 of unpaid installments on this phone and my number would have been blocked if activated. I have to return it. Be weary that there is not enough caution going into making sure these refurbished phones are in a condition to be activated.

  The phone is fine. Good shipping, packaging, etc. However, I believe this phone was meant for the Korean or Japanese market as there is no way to silence the camera shutter on this device. US buyers - be wary as these phones may have been made for different markets and are being resold.

  I would say overall it is pretty good. Was in good shape ascetically and the battery lasts a long time. However, the internet connection issues are really annoying. It will randomly go from full bars to zero for no reason. I have to put it in airplane mode and then wait a minute and take it back out of airplane mode. This usually does the trick and it goes right back to full service.  Sometimes I do have to to restart it to get it to pick back up service. This happens everywhere and multiple times a day so it is not a service availability issue, just a connection with the phone issue.

  It worked for a few months. I did not even own it for a year and it started to have problems. The letter ""I"" on the keyboard did not work. Texting and text speech did not work at all so I could not communicate over the phone other than calling someone. Apps open and closed on it's own. It played random videos on youtube that I did not clock on. It would try to download videos or apps on it's own. It would close me out on apps that I had open. The browser no longer loaded pictures on the screen. I contacted the support team, they said warranty was expired and to fix it myself with the help of repair shop. I loved the camera quality so much so it was horrible and inconvenient for me to let this phone go just because the screen was no longer responsive.

  I bought the unlocked iPhone, but it does not work with my Operator Card: The SIM card you have now installed in this iPhone belongs to a carrier that is not supported by the activation policy. Then I checked the IMEI. Here's what I read: This device is listed in the international blacklist. Will my phone no longer work? Sorry for the mistakes, I live in Ukraine

  Honestly, I was a bit nervous after reading a handful of bad reviews about folks past purchases, but was hard to pass up the deal.The day my new phone was set to arrive, I already expected to have some scratches from being dropped, minimum expectations for battery life, and possibility of the phone not being setup for AT&T as ordered.When I opened the phone, I was pleased to see it packaged professionally in bubble wrap. The phone had two layers of tape on front and pack to protect from scratches. It also had a screen protector already installed professionally (no bubbles).  I’ve gone over the surface several times and not found one scratch on this phone.The phone came with a generic charger which I used to plug in. The phone booted right up with 88% battery and 100% battery health, exceeding my expectations.Overall, I’m very pleased with the purchase and hope the folks with bad experiences were made right either with exchanges or their refunds. My experience was positive overall.

  This ""refurbished"" unit was sent to me from CellCow. Upon setup I was unable to click on many options and was generally having trouble navigating. Once I was able to make my way to the home screen I immediately went in to the notes app to test for areas where the screen wasn't receiving touch input. Sure enough, when trying to draw one continuous scribble inside of notes I discovered an obvious rectangle in the middle of the screen that wasn't registering any sort of touch. Aside from this dead zone the phone would also register a bunch of false input and do all sorts of crazy things without me even touching the screen.CellCow claims to have a 30-point inspection before sending these out but that is obviously not the case. This issue was caught by me immediately. I will be returning for a full refund and will be avoiding business with them in the future.

  When I first got the phone,  the battery life wasn't very good. When I contacted the company they said it was as good as could be expected, but offered for me to return it...I chose not to because it would leave my daughter without a phone and if that was ""as good as it gets"", why bother. So, now my daughter has had the phone for a couple months and she dropped it cracking the screen pretty bad. I took it to a phone repair place who told me that the battery was swollen and didn't even belong to that phone model along with many other parts. The outside may say one thing, but on the inside these phones are pieced together with whatever they can find that us somewhat compatible. If I spend $400 on a phone, refurbished or not...I want OEM parts, not parts from a different model. I wouldn't waste your time or money. Very disappointed!

  Was hesitant to buy due to the reviews. Those were from 2019 so after going back and forth with myself for about ten days I decided to buckle down and purchase. A bit pricey for my budget. Bc I do budget, but I haven’t bought myself a phone in over 4 years. Worth the purchase! One scratch on the front screen. I can deal with it. Otherwise looks absolutely brand new. Someone mentioned in their review that it came in a “weird box”, who cares about the box? Are you buying keeping iPhone boxes?

  I pulled the trigger on this with some trepidation based on a few of the horror stories in the reviews.  The price point and the return policy made it irresistible.  I'm glad I did.  My wife has essentially a brand new iPhone X for less than 50% what we would pay on apple.com or really any other refurb source I could find.  There is the tiniest of blemishes on the touch screen, and the battery maxes out at 85% of original capacity.  Both are well within the ""as-advertised"" parameters, and to be expected with a phone that's a few years old.  I couldn't be happier with the quality and condition of this phone and it only confirms that I will look to by a refurb every time I need to replace a phone in the future.  Based on this experience, I will probably look at Amazon first.

  Purchased the phone back in March! Was very happy with how it appeared as a refurbished phone. Even came with a screen protector already on it which I was impressed by, but should have actually checked why.I just had to replace the screen protector this week... discovered that the phone had some pretty bad scratches and buff marks in the glass. And when I wiped the screen to put the new protector on I discovered that they had put a very thin polish on some of the scuffs on the end of the screen, which came off with the cleaning wipe. I did not expect the phone to be perfect, due to it being refurbished. But I was disappointed that it was not previously noted in the description that the screen would be more damaged that typical.This is my 4th refurbished phone and my screen has never been this bad. The screen protector does hide it very well. But still frustrating none the less. So if you get a phone with a protector I recommend removing it and checking the screens quality.

  Unfortunately I am unhappy with this phone thus far because it was delivered LOCKED and therefore not useable. I have messaged the seller and am waiting for a reply which I’m sure is forthcoming. My frustration really stems from the fact that this is the third iPhone I’ve ordered since September and all three have been a problem and unusable. Phone #1 was also locked so returned and reordered fro Amazon but a different seller; the 2nd phone seemed fine for a few days then froze because it was water damaged from a prior owner- also returned, then # 3 reordered , Amazon, new vendor again- this phone is locked too though it also was advertised and ordered  as UNLOCKED. I am sheltering at home due to Covid-19 and have to send a helper out to Sprint to attempt to get service and also to the post office for returns as the 2nd Seller would not issue a pick up authorization. There was a charge of approximately 12$ for postage on that item which definitely should not have been my responsibility. This is not an inexpensive item and I am very disappointed in the process thus far!

  My renewed phone arrived today. I had an iPhone and this is my first new (to me) phone in years. It arrived late, but it was a weather issue coming from New York to California, so not a shipper issue. It was sent within 12 hours. The screen and body have no cosmetic issues. The battery health is 85% which isn’t awful, and so far it’s a better battery than my last phone. I did a direct transfer from my old phone, and the whole process including installing the updates and my apps took around two hours. So far I’m very happy with the purchase.

  The phone works just fine. Mine arrived with a battery life of 85%. The phone is not damaged, although I believe the screen on it is a replaced screen, the touch screen is finicky..and the screen itself seems raised. My iphone 6s the screen is smooth within the phone but this screen goes above the border of the phone if that makes sense? It's like taller than the border surrounding the phone..maybe thats how iphone X are..idk. Sometimes certain letters stop working, or I can't hold down when taking a video because it lifts off even if I didn't lift my finger..so I am always sure to use it in a hands-free mode when recording. I mean for $400 I can't complain. Pretty sure I paid more for my iphone 6S when it first came out and I bought it straight from the apple store lol. So I believe I got what I paid for. So am happy, and I recommend this seller.

  Got the phone and immediately had extreme ghosting issues (screen glitching out all over the place). Plus the screen had a greenish hue — they clearly replaced the glass with something cheap and didn't even do it properly. Will bump up to a 3-star if the refund process is smooth, but the phone was clearly not tested for quality.

  This is the SECOND time I purchased a phone from this seller. First was for me (iPhone 8)  and now I just got this one for my wife. The phone came sooner than expected! The product is used but in great condition. All of the functions work and it looks great!  This is an upgrade from an iPhone 7+, my wife is really enjoying the face recognition function. The phone charges well and a full battery lasts the day. Both front and back cameras take great pics!  Memory is what we expected and is much better then the 32gb on the old phone. These things really make a difference. The seller was great, reliable and honest. I got more than what I paid for and more then I expected!! Highly recommend both the phone and the seller!!

I mean it’s got some scuffs here and there on the bezel but the screen is perfect. Just put this phone in a nice case and you not anyone else will know it’s used. Batter life is 89 percent on mine. I don’t notice the drain too much.

  Service was great. Phone case way earlier than expected. Came with SIM election tools, charging cable (no charging brick), and the phone. Phone looked good, however there were issues with the Bluetooth and GPS. GPS was unusable in turn-by-turn mode as it would stay in the place you started from for miles. Bluetooth would disconnect every few minutes. Unfortunately had to return it as I use those features on a daily basis.

I took it to apple store and it is diagnosed with problem with logic board, Phone was originally purchased in Aug 2018, therefore, NO WARRANTY….  $426.00 for just short of 10 months of use and now its a paperweight, I’m not happy, Very Disappointed ….:(

Unfortunate that it didnt work and I have to wait quite a bit of time to get my refund back (Will take about 2 weeks to return phone, have it accepted for return, and receive refund).But that is the risk when buying refurbished electronics on Amazon I guess...

  The phone was reported STOLEN AND WAS SHUT OFF BY ATT. THIS SELLER IS A SCAMMER. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. Straight out of the box the phone had A LOT of scratches both on the screen and back of the phone. Pretty disappointed, knew the phone was coming at a discount but it’s basically already ready for a screen replacement. The phone itself is super glitchy, can’t even sign in to my WiFi on the next screen. It also does not come with any original box nor headphones. One after market, cheap phone charger included.

  Great Deal for an almost new unlocked iPhone X. Mine had some scuff marks on the side of the phone and on the top. Please see my photos I’ve included.  But my phone case covers all the marks- so no worries. Mine had a battery life value of 85% which is OK, wish it were better. But it will do! It’s 100% UNLOCKED. It worked no problem for Metro PCS. (Cost me $15 to activate at metro) But so far NO ISSUES with this iPhone. I will come back and edit if I run into any issues. I’ve had this for about a month. Works great! Please hit the helpful button if this review helped you out! -Jess

  My iPhone 6 started having battery problems so I decided to replace  it. Was going to go to a new 7 or 8, but saw I could get a fully restored X on Amazon for about the same price. Easy to set up. I honestly feel like it’s a new phone. The first thing I checked was the battery health and it was 100%! Everything functions perfectly. Love the Face ID. Great camera and sound. Once you get used to no home button, you won’t miss it. Without it the screen fills the whole phone. So the overall phone size is not too big, but you get more screen size - a win win in my opinion. So far I am presently satisfied.

  Phone was said to be CDMA and GSM unlocked. It wasn’t. Called Verizon and Apple after being declined at sprint. I was told by Verizon that the phone was never in their system. I was also told by apple that the phone was locked but they wouldn’t say by who.I’m a pretty patient person however, I will admit it was a very frustrating experience.That being said I just feel like I got unlucky. Other reviewers phones seemed to work so, there’s that.The phone itself was in near flawless condition, even with 100% battery health.In totality, I’d still recommend getting the phone, if you don’t want to buy it directly from apple. ($10 more)I was just unlucky.

  I purchased an iPhone X. The whole reason I made this purchase was because it was “Amazon guaranteed”. It arrived on a Thursday; Immediately when the phone arrived I noticed issues. Upon making my first call, the phone would turn off and the restart 5 or 6 times in a row, not even allowing me to access the Home Screen. So I called Amazon. I talked to Ryan E.  A “customer support representative” at Amazon. Ryan gave three possible options1) bring the phone to an Apple store and they will either fix the problem or replace it,2) return the item with possible two week reimbursement.3) ship it to Apple and they would fix the problemI chose to set up an appointment at the Apple store to have the problem fixed.At which point Ryan E. Booked the appointment for me, over the phone, with an Apple representative as it was a Amazon guaranteed product. Tuesday I drove 200 miles away to the Apple store. The Apple representative performed a diagnostic and informed me the main processing chip was faulty and therefore the phone needed to be replaced and they even had the exact replacement in store. As Amazon had already verified everything would be taken care of cost wise, I called Amazon to provide a “genius  bar work authorization & service confirmation” form for replacement as it would cost $549.00. Ashley C, who told me that they would not pay for the replacement and the only option for me was to return the product and get a refund. I then told Ashley exactly what Ryan told me. Ashley said I was wrong and that amazon did not set up an appointment for an apple store repair, and that I would need to prove the appointment was made by a representative of amazon. When I explained that I had email verification she then said ""I see the email"" then refused to follow through on replacement even though and told me that my only option was to return the phone or keep it upon bringing up what amazon had previously promised like magic I was disconnected. At that point since I had an appointment and I didn't want to take up anyone else's time; I decided to leave. When I got back to my car, I once again decided to call Amazon. This time while talking with the representative Ashley I was told that the phone I purchased was not amazon guaranteed, even though the actual iPhone X amazon listing specifically says ""Amazon Guaranteed; eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days"". Furthermore, Ashley told me that a return and refund is my only option I brought up that amazon listed the product under Amazon guaranteed specifically states ""Quick support for claims and troubleshooting. Eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied."" she continued by stating the product was not amazon guaranteed and stated that the listing is removed and they can't do anything further. When I asked to speak to a manager I was transferred to Sam G. who by the way was incredibly rude, and refused to help me in any way and refused to replace the product, or assist me with anything other that returning the iPhone. I am disgusted at the way this whole situation has been handled. Even after reviewing amazons guaranteed policy I still cannot find where it states amazon has the ability to refuse to follow through with their guaranteed product replacement. I do know that I will not only be bringing this up with the BBB but also the attorney general.

  Now for the people who are reading this message it is important for you to know. if you want a really good offer for a really cheap price go ahead and take the chance Buy this iPhone. There’s no scam is the real deal. now note this you are buying a used iPhone. Second thing that you need to keep in mind Is the battery capacity if you’re looking for a phone you want to try to aim for 95% battery capacity is your best bet when I received mine I got it at 80% battery capacity so that’s also another thing to keep in mind when you’re buying a used phone make sure you’re looking at that battery capacity it’s really important another thing you will receive scratches on the display and the back glass in my opinion this is nothing to cry over just throw a case on it and it should look pretty good. you also want to make sure that your face recognition is on point make sure that everything on the phone is responsive after Unboxing thank you guys so much for taking your time in reading this long message hopefully you bought your product and enjoyed it. Peace <U+270C><U+FE0F><U+0001F60E>

  The phone arrived right on time and in great condition. The charger that was included worked great.However, I think this phone must be from Korea or Japan, where it's apparently illegal to take digital photos without an audible shutter click. There is absolutely no way to turn off the sound, even when the phone is muted and the volume is turned all the way down. It happens in every major application that uses the camera.As an art student, I take TONS of pictures, and the camera is the primary reason why I got the iPhone X. I took it to multiple IT stores where they told me to either return the phone or to jailbreak it to rewrite the lines of code that affect the feature (and jailbreaking voids any warranty or service that Apple offers). I'm returning it because it's too big of a hiccup to work around (can't take pictures in a wedding/library/quiet setting at all...!).Ideally, they should make sure that the country of origin is taken into consideration before selling someone a product if it's going to be such a major feature difference.TLDR: nice phone, in great condition, good price, came on time, but this particular phone is unusable for anyone who likes to take pictures

  The item came exactly as describes so there is no complaints! The battery life span was at 92% when it came so hopefully that’s good. Everything is working great! The phone is in good condition with no flaws. However, it doesn’t have as long as a battery life as my old iPhone 7 does and it runs out of battery much quicker. BUT that may just be the iPhone x itself and it is as expected since it’s more complicated than the iPhone 7 so it may need to use up more battery life. I don’t really know. But other than that the phone is really good and I would definitely recommend this seller.

  I love iPhone. I love this iPhone. However, the screen had 2 very minor scratches that my friend noticed on it. I couldn't even see them so I'm not upset about that. I AM upset that the phone was supposed to come with at least 80% of battery. Mine had 79%.  I did not return the phone because I had planned to replace the battery even at 80%, which cost me $50. It's just disturbing to buy from someone who promises to follow the Premium policy and simply does not. Other than that, the phone is working well, and I love it. Maybe try buying from a different seller.

    IT'S NOT FULLY UNLOCKED and WORST customer support
  
","









  
  
    
  As soon as the product arrived I tested it and see what went wrong, I am surprise but also disappointed in the same time. So here are my pros and cons about the item; Pros :What I love the most about it is the touch screen, I was very surprise how the touch screen works perfectly smooth, the battery life is great and the screen so crispy clear.Cons :Since the seller didn't provide the real picture of the item so It's very disappointing to find out that there are tiny scratches around the camera as you can see from the picture 2. It is not noticeable but it's not acceptable for me. Also it's not fully unlocked. Why ? Because I tested to make a phone call using my SIM card (Total wireless) it seems to work with LTE, however the internal speaker is very deep as in the other voice of the person I was talking to is very far although it's already on the highest volume.Then me and my husband tried to use his phone to call my number, but unfortunately it didn't work, so I thought maybe we have to be a little bit further, then he went outside while I'm inside calling using his phone.But again it didn't receive anything. As you can see on pic 1, it went to a voicemail meanwhile the iPhone didn't show anything. But I didn't take a pic of this iPhone received the voicemail notification on inbox.However I didn't try using speaker or headset so I have no clue about that.ALSO, the most annoying thing is that I tried to call their customer service and  I spoke to one of them over the phone regarding my issue but she didn't bother to ask what would be the issue about the item etc instead she refused to help me create a shipping pick up label for UPS and persistently saying that they only provide UPS label for drop off. As I explained my situation that we do have stay home order but she only saying that I can request pick up service and other shipping services but it'll be in my cost, she was also mentioned that I can return the item when the stay home order is over, which I don't know when. Then again she refused to help me to create the shipping label for UPS pick up. In the end she hangs up the phone on my face. When I report it to the seller via message box the other customer service completely ignore my concern.Anyways, their refund will be issued 3 days after the item has arrived which after the inspected the whole thing with the item. I asked them about how long the item will be arrived they didn't even give me an estimate time.This is my first time experience but It's SO disappointing. PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM A 3rd PARTY SELLER.It's too much hustle in your part if you're hoping to get it done quickly. Hope this helps.

  Ok, so I was a little afraid buying this because of the reviews left by others, but let me say, the phone I received was AMAZING, no scratches whatsoever, like NONE. I don't know what happened with others, but I received an amazing iPhone. Comes in bubble wrap and comes with a 3rd party charger and wall-brick, it could've used better shipping materials though considering its a $500 phone. I would definitely buy again for sure!!

  i bought my phone about a month ago, so i can safely say that it is in good working condition and there aren’t many glitches. However, there’s a part of the touch screen that doesn’t work at all, and the screen is not very sensitive. I have to press the screen hard to select something or type a message. This was disappointing and challenging to adjust to this, and hard to use when part of the screen does not let me select it. However, the battery life has proven sufficient so far.

  The iphone 10 came with all the stuff it said it would come with. (charger.) Battery life was good. Charges well. Pretty good phone. The only problem was when I spoke on the phone. I could barely hear the caller but the caller could hear me. I had to always put the phone on speaker to hear the person calling. Which isn't too bad, but if your in an open area, it can kinda be annoying. But its not too bad because its advised for people not to put phones very close to ears anyways because of radiation.But overall good phone.

They were quick to email a shipping label pdf. Sent phone back. Was recieved on 28th. I was informed there is a 24 hold for employee safety before they could process. Was also then told 5-7 business days. It's been a few days over. Sent an email asking for updated. Will update later for final review. But...buyer beware.

  Product came with a broken LCD screen.. definitely not worth the price. They must use some cheap screens or something, or perhaps it’s even a hardware issue. It looked like it was nice on the outside tho. Almost looked new. So it was a let down experience and time wasting. Maybe you’ll get luckier than me. It’s refurbished after all, it’s always going to be a gamble.UPDATE: Seller got the return back and says the envelope was empty. It’s been about 2 months and still no refund. Horrible experience so far. Claim was opened a month ago and Amazon hasn’t done anything to figure out what’s happened to the product.

  I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews but after doing a lot of research on amazon and other refurbished websites I decided to pull the trigger on this one seeing as I could easily return it. The phone is great! 89% battery life that lasts most of the day, excellent exterior condition. No issues thus far!! Would recommend!!

  Although we’ve only been using our new phones for a couple days, we (my wife & I), both LOVE them so far.We were both VERY skeptical of purchasing “Renewed” phones. But Amazon’s return policy made it much less of a gamble.The phones both arrived in near-mint condition and both also have a tempered glass screen protector pre-installed. The phones are blazing fast and have beautiful displays.I won’t hesitate to purchase our next upgrade from this seller.

  I bought this iPhone for my husband and he is thrilled with it. He loves the facial recognition, and the long life of the batter. While this was a refurbished phone, it was just like new. No dings or scratches and everything about it works perfectly. And to top it off, the price was right. I am very pleased with this purchase and will surely look to this seller when replacing my phone.

  I am VERY HAPPY with this purchase. Cosmetically the only blemish was down at the bottom where you’d enter the charger where there are a few scuffs but that’s it! Screen is flawless and body is otherwise also flawless and it performs like a dream! The only thing I wish would’ve been better is the battery life which is currently at 86%. Other than that, I have zero complaints and would recommend this seller to anyone. Very pleased!

  There is a spot on the back camera that won’t go away and it won’t connect with sprint it came with a crack in the center of the screen  :( but other wise it came in good condition there are scratches on the sides but if I buy a case it’ll be okay idk if the 400$ was worth the spot on the back camera and the crack in the screen cause I use the back camera so much but it should be fine till I get a replacement

  I sent this phone back.  It would lock up; need to be re-booted to get out of apps.  It would take my news app and shuffle items on the fly like it was a deck of cards ... it would do the same with my photos.  Unlike other Amazon returns, I had to wait until this phone got back to the seller and then wait again while they checked it through, which tied up my money for longer than I appreciated.

  I purchased this phone in April 2020 and its been glitchy and now the top inch of my phone does not respond to me touching it.  So its almost useless to use, since I cant even do something as simple as down load software or acknowledge something that's on the screen.  I have never had anything like this happen to any iPhone I have purchased.

  I’ve been using my iPhone X for about a week now. It is Amazon Renewed. I was nervous about purchasing a used phone, until I started using it.No glitches, no hiccups, no scratches.So far, I’ve noticed that the battery life is quite long. I read books using the Books app, and I enjoy that my battery can keep up.The screen is edge to edge which brings up the overall image quality, in my opinion.The battery health did not come 100%, but rather 96% and that makes sense for a previously owned phone.I will probably buy my next phone this way as well.

  I am incredibly satisfied! The phone came in perfect condition! It had about an 80% of battery life upon arrival, and the phone synced from my other device smoothly. My SIM card immediately worked once I put it in. The phone came with no scratches at all, looks brand new! I think it’s worth it! The photos are great! The storage is 64g just like I ordered. It came with an adapter, phone charger, and SiIM tray ejecter.UPDATE:Two days later, I found out that I could make calls and receive them just well, but I can’t hear the person on the other line, unless it’s on speaker. Yet, they can hear me just fine. So, I contacted the seller to see if I can get a replacement. I’ll update as soon as something happens.

  I had this phone for only 4 months and it completely broke. I brought it to a football game and it was in my pocket, zipped up the whole time. After the game it just started flashing the apple logo. I took it to a phone repair store and they opened it up and were surprised it ever worked, saying a lot was wrong within. Just pay the money and get your phone from apple/whatever your cell carrier is.

  I was skeptical as well as a little nervous ordering this phone after reading the reviews. ... who wouldn’t be??But I finally talked myself in to buying it and now I am going to give you reader’s what you want! An honest review.1st off, it came a day earlier than expected.2nd, I unboxed it frightened that it would be broken, or not turn on. (As I had read in a few other reviews)I was so shocked however, when I pulled the phone out of its box and found it to be in perfect condition. I looked all over it for any sort of cosmetic damages, and could find not one!!Next nail biting moment.... would it even turn on??? I had read reviews saying the phone would not turn on, so this was a bit concerning as I pressed that side button, fingers crossed that luck would still be in my favor. It was almost fully charged!! Now the last test. Was the phone paid off? Truly unlocked for any service?? I had also read reviews saying the phones could not be used on network due to not being paid off or in some cases even stolen!So I called my service provider, gave them the imei and my phone number and it was switched over without any issues at all.I am SUPER SUPER happy with my purchase!! Thank you!!

  Gosh dang do I love my iPhone, this is coming from a previous Samsung user who was DEDICATED  to Samsung prior. And would scoff anyone who dare say Apple was better. But a lot has changed since the iPhone 4, and I love the fact that I don’t have to have a huge phone to have a nice phone screen! I got this item on time, a little disappointed that the phone was a bit dirty, had a screen protector installed (but dirty) and slight scratches on the screen and back glass. Battery life says 89% which is a turd ton better than some of the reviews on here. Spoke with the seller and they are very quick to respond, would purchase again

  On September 9, 2020 I purchased an Apple iPhone X 64 GB factory unlocked smartphone. The price for this unit was $429.99. I was able to transfer the contents of my iPhone 6 to the iPhone X. The iPhone X worked for approximately a week, and then I went into a black screen mode. I Googled repairs and then contacted the Apple site to see about making the black screen go away. Nothing worked! I finally took the phone to my Apple Store in the Mall of New Hampshire in Manchester New Hampshire and the technician took the phone into the back room. The technician came back and informed me that the phone worked but the display did not. The display was aftermarket, not an Apple product. But for an additional $270+ I could have an Apple display installed. No thank you!!! I’ll return the phone to Amazon. The Apple technician stripped the iPhone X of all information and returned it to its original new in the box state.What I’m looking for now is a return authorization for the phone and a refund of the $429.99 to my credit card. I will then purchase a refurbished phone, from Apple. The phone may cost more but I will have the comfort of knowing that is Apple refurbished, warrantied, and supported by Apple.

  Ive read a few bad reviews on this one but this phone not only came in fast (I ordered it Jan 15 and it came in the 18th) but there were no scratches at all and the phone turned right on! No malfunctions of any kind, so far. The only thing I noticed is that the battery won’t fully charge.

  This product (Apple iPhone X from MobileSpree) seems to deliver as promised from user reviews. Following additional user reviews from YouTube, the device appears to still be installed with an Apple Certified OLED screen and I was unable to observe any screen burn-in. I am a little disappointed that iOs software indicates Battery Health is at 84% Maximum Capacity, but this still meets the promise from Amazon Refurbished devices of being at least >80%. I did not see any blemishes or scratches; thought the device had a polished screen, I noticed a little grime (probably oil residue from hands of previous owner) along the power and volume buttons.Overall, I am currently satisfied with device. I will, however, still purchase a 2- or 3-year warranty to cover the device.

  I bought this for my Wife for her birthday in January to replace her iPhone 7. Neither she or I are tech nerds and couldn’t care less about having the latest and greatest when it comes to phones. We both have used the iPhone platform for at least a decade, so naturally, we stick with it due to the familiarity with the operation and use of these Apple products.I was a little worried about when reading reviews as some people loved this product and others complained about scratches and imperfections. The one I received was flawless. I didn’t see a single scratch or blemish on it. The battery was dead when it arrived, but quickly fired up after being charged for a few minutes.The battery life seems fine, even though the battery life feature says that it had a max of 86%. My wife hasn’t had an issue at all with it draining in an inordinately fast manner and she used it a lot.She especially likes the privacy feature in which the screen isn’t visible to others from the side.Since she and I both aren’t keen on the facial recognition feature that replaced the Finger ID on this phone, she just uses the 6 digit passcode to unlock. It was slightly annoying at first, but not an issue considering that’s how it used to be in the “old” days of iPhones anyway.This phone does everything my wife wants it to do and arrived in absolutely pristine condition. The box is generic, there are no ear buds with it and the lightning cable and block are also generic. None of these make any difference to her since she has Bluetooth ear buds already and we have about a dozen blocks and cables already. The seller made it clear what would come with the phone, so we were already okay with that.All in all, this was a great value. I think my total was right around $400 for a significant upgrade to her iPhone 7 and she was super happy.

  1. Has notable scratches on the back and the sides. Infact a sticker on the box says ""bad back and body"" !!. 2. Battery health is at 93% which is not great but ok I guess.However while charging touch screen goes nuts and can't use the touch screen properly ! And also if i try to use the phone while charging the battery level drops (while charging) as well ! Hence i'm pretty sure this has a bad battery.3 The charging cable / charger I got with the device is not from apple and the cable doesn't even work.. 4 The phone gets super hot within like 5 mins after light use... Overall I'd say not to purchase this. It's not worth the money and it's not ""refurbished"" for sure.. These are used devices with defects

  Got the phone yesterday, beside a little scratch on the front screen, the phone looks great, just like brand new. Batter life is at 89%, this could be better but I’m ok with it. It came with a pre-installed screen protector that it’s a bit wide placed, but it’s a not a issue. The value for the money is 11/10

  After spending time reading the reviews I wasn’t sure if it would work with Verizon. When I received the phone I popped in my sim and worked perfectly. The phone had minor blemishes... nothing to be concerned with... what you would expect with a refurbished phone. I’ve had the phone for almost a month and everything is working great! Overall I would recommend.

  El equipo me llegó en casi excelente estado, el único inconveniente es que tiene un pequeño desgaste en el bisel cerca del puerto de carga. No tiene ningún rayón. Hubiera esperado algo más de condición en la batería, me llegó con un 83%. Aún así, muy contento con mi compra.

  You can see tons of scratches when light shines on the screen.

I would suggest just buying a new phone.

  I was really skeptical about getting this phone given the bad reviews I saw on here but honestly, I was surprised to see the phone was in really good condition it was fully unlocked I didn’t have any trouble getting the service on. It had a battery capacity of 81% which isn’t good but I’m not upset just cause the phone is really good. For the price It turned out to be a great purchase. I totally recommend if your not trying to spend much on a phone

A crook service rep called Estrella promised me that once I send the fix invoice they will refund me.

  UPDATE:  I just realized that the ear speaker isn't working properly. I had been using on speaker only, but when I tried to listen with the phone to my ear, it was distorted and could only be understood at a very low volume level.The rest of the phone is great and I don't want to start over with a return.  I just wish the ear speaker worked right.  FYI, I tried to troubleshoot the issue and I did make some software changes - Accessibility/hearing aid - as was directed, but in my case it didn't make it any better.FIRST COMMENT: This phone was exactly as described, in great condition, works perfectly and was delivered promptly.  Overall, very pleased so far!  Only had the phone for a few days.

  I've never written a review for anything but I had to this one time to make sure others don't go through what I go through on a daily basis. From the moment I turned it on, sometimes the screen wouldn't light up but it would still react to touch. It would only unlock on the first try maybe 30% of the time. Few months later the touch screen isn't working while still not lighting up on the first try of trying to unlock it. I bought this phone a month before the pandemic started and I work at a grocery store and I'm also a college student so I didn't have the time and also couldn't risk going without a phone for however long it would take them to send me a new one. And when I did make an effort early on to return it they were very unclear and broad about their instructions. Also the calling line did not even work. I would not risk buying one of these phones from this company again, horrible phone that gives me problems every hour of the day and cost me so much inconvenience and horrible customer service. Do not buy from them.

  I don't often review Amazon purchases, but I'm going to make an exception in this case...The phone arrived 3 days ahead of it's earliest predicted arrival date, was 96% charged upon arrival, and appeared to be completely unblemished in any way.  In fact, the only way I could discern it from a brand new phone was that the battery health was at 86% which was entirely acceptable. The new aftermarket usb adapter and lightening cord were included in the box and, as a pleasant surprise, there was even a new screen protector installed on the phone as well as a new basic slip on phone case included which I hadn't expected to receive.The phone was unlocked, and went through the startup and initialization procedure which one would expect of a new iphone.  It worked seamlessly with my old sim, and did an awesome job of migrating my settings and data over from my old i6.  The data and hotspot speeds crushed those of the old i6 which I replacing.I could not be happier with this purchase!

  So like many of you, you are probably checking out every last review that has been posted about the phones sold by this 3rd party company. I too researched and found that the iPhone X was the best buy for me and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a used phone. I was hesitant about buying a phone through these guys because you really don't know what you are going to receive and the reviews were mixed.Once I received the phone I noticed how little to no bubble wrapping was used. The phone was too small for the box and I could shake it and hear the phone being tossed from side to side in the box. I wasn't too happy about that and was worried that the phone might be damaged.In the end the phone was perfectly fine, no scratches and it really looked brand new! I was so surprised and happy to find that the phone WAS unlocked as advertised and that the battery life was at 87% which is more than I expected. I bought the phone to take with my back to Argentina so once I get back I hope to continue with no problems! Thanks for the lovely phone!

  I’ve had my new IPhone X for 3 days now and I have had ZERO problems. I’m super happy and satisfied with it. I had my concerns about ordering and read all the reviews before hand. Naturally, I was worried about receiving a faulty phone, but (so far) it has been just like new. No visible damage or scratches. It connected to my carrier (Straight Talk) without problems with a new SIM. The phone arrived with a charging cord and plug in, as well as a screen protector! That was a nice surprise. I read reviews where people were passed the phone didn’t come with head phones, but they clearly are people that can’t read. The description clearly states it doesn’t have headphones. Overall, I recommend this phone and seller! Thoroughly satisfied!

   I had this phone for less than 2 weeks. A few days ago it started stuttering when I press side button to wake phone, turn on, etc. today 2/23/2021 it went crazy. Woke up this morning and the screen is completely black with glitches. This phone is the worst I have purchased through Amazon. Thank God I still had my 6s that still works! I want ALL my money back.

I believe when it comes to electronics please becareful. Next time.. there wont be a next time.. It came with a roku head charger and a weird sim portal..

  Looked in good condition until I saw the battery life, the battery capacity was 78% this left me speechless. Someone has been using this phone for years. Not only that but the speakers are horrid when I call someone. I have to put on speaker and it only helps a little. I didn’t notice these things until later on. So I kept the phone and replaced the batteries, hopefully the speaker as well. But these phones ain’t the actual thing. These aren’t straight from apple. Consider yourself lucky if you get a perfect phone. Do yourself a favor and buy it from the actual company. Take care.

  I honestly wasn’t expecting the phone to be this good. I’ve gotten a refurbished/renewed iPhone on Amazon before and while it was good, the quality wasn’t a high as this one. The battery capacity was at 93% compared to other refurbished ones at 80% and I couldn’t find any noticeable scratches or dents or marks. For a phone originally marked at $1000, $400 is definitely a steal.

   I was so worried about buying this phone because of the reviews and I was putting it off purchasing this phone because of it. When I received it, I was so happy. Inside the box was the phone, sim card tool, and a 3ft iPhone cable (i already have like 4 of these cables lol) with the USB adapter plug. It had very minimal scratches on the screen which honestly, was so unnoticeable that I didn’t realize until the next day I had it.- The speakers work perfectly and calls sound clear so 10/10- Face recognition is a 10/10- Camera and photos are 10/10- Battery life and max capacity are (I got 89%!) 10/10- Scratches on mine are so small you can’t even notice them so 10/10Guys, this phone is like new, and for the price, it is so worth it. I know a lot of you are worried about the battery life and health, but as an iPhone user since 2012, it is no problem for me to invest money in replacing the battery (I used the iPhone 4 for 4 years and went through one battery, every other iPhone I had, I switched over preference even while the battery was in good shape lol). I know that if maybe you don’t receive a great phone (trust me, I’ve been there before), it’s tedious to wait for a new phone to arrive, but please don’t be afraid of investing in this one because it is so worth it.

  My iPhone arrived quicker than I thought, which was appreciated since I needed to replace one that was dying. First, the packaging was a lovely surprise! I usually receive refurbished products in a plain cardboard box with some bubble wrap. It was nice to see that care was taken in how it was shipped and how the box was designed....well done!! My iPhone X has been working like a charm! It looks brand new. The clarity is wonderful and everything has been working perfectly. I usually purchase refurbished and look for the best price, but because of the experience I had with this seller, I will look to them first if I need another refurbished device.UPDATE: my experience with this seller has been good but now my product is defective. The left side of the touch screen has stopped working. I have had for only just over a monthSECOND UPDATE: back up to 5 stars...the seller responded to my Concern & will be refunding me for the defective iPhone. I have actually ordered a replacement through the same seller due to their good customer service.

Both phones are in perfect condition. They look brand new3. It's been four days, and battery life is phenomenal. Over 70% battery left after 12 hours4. Facial recognition is new to me. No more typing in pass-codes or fingerprint reading! Yes!5. I highly recommend this seller

  This iPhone X works just the way it was created; all features are available to me with the AT&T network compatibility.  Next time I would get an unlocked compatible with all carriers, GSM, but this is no problem for me right now.  As an Android user all my life I decided to join the crowd and have a phone easy to use.  I was quarantining so i had 6 days of YouTube and apple online docs to teach myself how to use and the tricks to make it more efficient.  I am very happy that i got this phone....as I always say: all vehicles (except electric) shift - what's the great thing about doing it manually!? I recommend this phone highly.

  PLEASE NOTE: iPhone X 256GB was my purchase. I returned the first phone because I was not happy with the screen quality. I felt at arms length it had visible scratches on the screen I could see.  I wasn’t after perfection but knew it could be better. I am leaving all 5 stars now because I returned the first and had a replacement that met my expectations in around 5-6 days (that’s me shipping back first phone and then them shipping another phone to me upon receiving my return).  They also covered all fees associated with return process.  No scratches at all on second phone. Basically flawless. I recommend picking your seller wisely. I searched and found hybrid IT and they did not disappoint throughout the whole process.  If you pay attention to the ratings of the particular seller you are buying from, you can get a better idea for what you can expect.  This phone is excellent and I am glad I chose the particular seller I went through on this refurbished phone. I went with a seller with the highest overall customer rating I could find.

  This phone is so suitable for what I needed in a phone—really long battery life, more security with Face ID, and a decent amount of storage. But one issue has plagued my phone: the touch screen. I’m not sure what it may be (an almost invisible imperfection on the screen or a hardware problem are probably the two most likely suspects), but my screen tends to glitch the hell out on me from time to time.Sometimes it’s when my phone is starting to warm up, sometimes it’s when I’m on low battery, and sometimes it’s at totally random times. The glitches mainly affect the very bottom of my screen, either making it impossible for me to swipe up to change apps or unlock my phone, or constantly wiggling around my whole screen without me touching it; additionally often clicking on things I never clicked on. It’s so infuriating that I’ve brought my rating down to a 2.Surely this isn’t an issue for anyone else, right? Because I’ve looked this up extensively and seemingly I’m one of very few people having this issue at all. Hell, not a single person who bought from this seller here on Amazon has had the same issue as me from what I’ve seen! I’m glad that there are some people out there who know this issue exists and they have solutions to them, but I can’t solve the issue I’m having with my own phone because of accessibility issues when it comes to certain tools or computer programs to fix the issue.Lesson of the day: don’t buy a used phone from Amazon. I was let down for the first time with my old 6s, and now I’ve been let down for the second (and last) time with my X. If you’re gonna get a used phone, just hope your friend or one of your family members is getting a new phone, or just buy a new phone if you’re getting impatient waiting for that lucky day of yours to come.

    Beware This Product is Not Eligible For Apple Care

  The phone came without blemish.  Everything looks great and the storage is eligible.  The screen looks good however, there is a device wide fault to these models which causes ghost texting.  It will take over your phone and become very frustrating trying to use or even place a call.  I contacted Apple Care to fix the problem as I saw it was common for this device.  I was told because this retailer is not an authorized Apple retailer that I would have to pay for the repair.  I would suggest that you purchase from an authorized dealer.  The warranty plan with this phone only says for accidents and not defects.

  The only reason it’s gets a 4 and 3 for battery life is because the battery says it’s at 92% which is good, but it still dies rather quickly and I wish it would at least have a 20% charge by the end of the day, but it’s been dying before the sun goes down.. a little disappointed there. The hardware is great, the screen is a beautiful, thanks to Apples collaboration with Samsung, and even with the couple scratches on the screen (I hardly ever notice them) the phone itself is WELL worth the buy maybe not such a high price would have like it lower for the buy but all around a great phone from Apple.

  Refurbished Suddenly stopped working after a few days.  It lost all bars and connection to phone service signal.  Zero bars.  Put my SIM card in another phone, which worked great.  Took it to an Apple store, they said I bought a defective phone.  I’ve bought many refurbished phones, but I simply do not recommend this particular seller.  Also, be fully aware of their outrageous restocking fees that are not pre disclosed when ordering!!  Also, expect several weeks for your refund (whatever amount that is, it varies based upon their interesting criteria which no other seller has that I’ve seen).  That’s how they make money off selling junk phones.

  We bought this phone because of the thousands of great reviews, and were really bummed to find that while the phone worked it was not unlocked for AT&T. We even took it to both the AT&T and Apple stores to try and work with it and get it working, but both said that the phone was not on the right network to be able to work and be unlocked for AT&T. When the Apple store looked at the settings they said it was only unlocked for Verizon and had appeared at an Apple store two months prior for the same issue and had been returned to Amazon. So this phone has been sold twice and wasn't able to work for the buyer for how it was advertised. It was super frustrating, so we just went ahead and bought a good phone from the Apple store, which we just have done from the start. I'm sure it would have been lovely if we got what was advertised, but we didn't.

  I’ll be honest, I was VERY skeptical about ordering despite the good and bad reviews, but after researching and looking at overall/ satisfactory ratings, I decided to order this on a Wednesday morning and I got it THURSDAY AFTERNOON! I expected at least a week for it to be delivered like it said, but I am MORE THAN happy!!! Got it as a birthday gift for my friend and I am amazed— it looks and acts brand new!!! Not one scratch, or any type of damage to the phone. It was perfectly wrapped in the protective plastic like a standard iPhone out of the Apple Store. Came with a generic usb iPhone charger/charging port. My warranty papers came in the packaging box. It ALSO included the glass screen protector on the phone already!! That was a HUGE plus for me!!!! (Not sure if it’s standard with every purchase) but thanks again!!!!!!!

Immediately the phone began to overheat during setup, finally after 3 hours of sitting and waiting it was ready to go!  Only immediately I noticed every picture has a mysterious blob on it.  All Google searches said both items were the result of water damage.Returned phone for full refund and ordered the 3rd (it's perfect so far).

  My phone came looking pristine. Only the tiniest scratch on the screen and spotless and functional almost everywhere else. The only issue I’ve had is the ear speaker is SO QUIET. Like can’t distinguish any words from the other side of the call. The mic works great. The loud speakers seem to be almost blown, sounding metallic at full volume. Luckily I don’t have to return it since I can easily replace the speakers myself For about 75$ instead of paying 250-500$ at Apple-certified repair locations. I know I can return it and exchange it but seeing as its in great shape externally I’d rather go without the gamble of getting a worse off device. You’re buying a used phone without seeing it first, it happens. I just don’t see how the speakers could be overlooked when it was brought back in by the previous owner.

  Please read before buying: My phone has been holding up great after a month of using it. Only problem is my phone was made for the Japanese/Chinese market and my camera shutter sound won’t turn off. Other than that... Battery is great, face ID is amazing, but after reading a lot of the reviews I’d say that I wouldn’t recommend buying from this seller. They are difficult to contact and if you have any problems they seem to turn you away and blame the buyer. Yes, it’s a good deal considering this phone was originally sold at $1000, but i’ve read reviews that the phone was locked because of the difference in country, it was originally stolen or the phone plan hasn’t been entirely paid off. Also, their “refurbishments” aren’t really refurbishments. Again, I feel like I got extremely lucky with my phone. There’s only one problem that really isn’t that big of a problem. But please, if you really want a good quality phone for around this price, check with your carrier and see if they have some discounted phones or refurbished phones that are actually refurbished. Better safe than scammed.

  I was hoping to get a new, unlocked, refurbished iPhone to surprise my boyfriend. The phone came, and was a little dinged up, but nothing too horrible. I also noticed that the battery life was already stated to be at ~85%, which is not what I consider refurbished (should be like new??). Nevertheless, I still gave it to him and he started the process of switching everything over to his new phone. He wasn't able to get his SIM card to recognize, so we had to go to the T-Mobile store. They told us at the store, after quickly looking up the phone serial number, that this phone is LOCKED and is registered as a lost or stolen phone. It is completely unusable to us, and we WASTED HOURS of our time. I am in the process of sending it back for a refund (as well as the accessories we bought separately which we now can't use). The seller, Chubbiestech, is completely unreachable when I call the phone number to try to get more information on ensuring a successful return. I have not been able to contact them and hopefully can get the information I need from Amazon.Overall this experience has been horrible and upsetting and a waste of time. I am extremely disappointed and embarrassed that I gave this as a gift, only to find out this unusable phone has likely been stolen from someone and sold to me.

  My wife and I have been looking for new iPhones, but didn't want to live with another two year contract with Verizon, So I looked around for used/renewed iPhone X's and found this seller. Buying a renewed iPhone so far is the way to go. No two year contracts with cellular provider and a practically a new iPhone with lots of memory. I would at this high recommend this company for purchasing renewed iPhone X.

  Really disappointed with this seller and the phone. Don’t waste your time or money! To begin, when we received the phone and tried to connect it to a carrier we were told the phone is locked. Informed the seller and they insisted it was unlocked. Attempted to connect to another carrier and again told it was locked. Contacted the seller a second time and instead of fixing it they tried to give me steps to do the job myself, as annoyed as I was having to do it myself, it still didn’t work. After many messages, the phone still was not unlocked!!! Finally we decided to return it and it’s been delivered for a week now and still NO REFUND has been issued!!!Throughly disappointed! Don’t waste your time/money there advertisement is not at all what they delivered!
