Reviewed in India on 21 October 2018,Ashutosh Parida,Honest review of an edm music lover,No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.. 1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m. 2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed). 3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.. 4. No pouch provided.. 5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic.

Reviewed in India on 30 June 2020,Vins,"A good earphone but with some issues, read this to find out more","I'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones.. PROS:. 1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.. Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.. Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.. Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.. 2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.. 3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.. 4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.. 5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.. 6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.. 7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.. 8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.. 9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.. CONS:. 1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.. 2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.. 3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.. Final words:. Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly.. Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphones(@1599rs poor in sound quality but better in all other terms)..

It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.. *Experience:*. The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.. Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.. *Sound Quality:*. The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.. *Build Quality:*. Build quality is really good. No issues with that.. *Battery life*. Satisfied with battery life.

Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar.

Reviewed in India on 2 July 2019,TrustedReviewer,One of the worst earphone I’ve had,"I’ve been using this for past few months now.. At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.. Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.. 1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.. 2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.. 3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.. 4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.. 5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.. 6. Poor Battery level indicator: if the battery level is full, then you’d be rest assured that you’ll have battery power for 2-3 hrs.. If the level is less than full e.g 80-90%, you can expect battery to run out in around 2 hrs.. So, the battery level indicator is not true indicator of actual battery level. Which means, you always keep it 100% charged if you don’t wanna risk running out of battery.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers..

When I received it was 100% charged. I started using it. Today the only challenge I saw was it was not connecting with my Bluetooth when it was left with 20% battery. I put it on charge. It recharged within the time of 1 hour or so.. Date : August 17, 2019 - I am not music freak but the quality and sound is good for music. I majorly use it for my long day calls through Skype. In starting it was good, there were no issues. After few days I started facing connectivity issues. On 15th I was watching something or other whole day. I noticed that till the time I was using it the battery % was 100. I took a break and reconnected it was like 80%. This was the percentage after a regular play time of approx 3 hrs. Suddenly it started giving audio message ,oops and all that . The battery was showing 20% and it turned off at 20% battery. This was little upsetting for me. I requested for a replacement so I will be getting it on Aug 20, 2019.. In this 1 year I have used 5 Bluetooth earphones. iBall, U8i, Samsung Muffspro and boAT.

Even though never has my earphones touched water, I accepted that and asked for the solution, but then the twist started!. They refused to repair it even on payment basis - reason that they were just there to replace the piece if it was a manufacturer defect. They genuinely were not their for any repair work.. They asked me to talk with the call centre executive to find the repair solution but the call could not be connected to the executive in spite of 20mins of waiting.

Lows and mids are clear with an adequate amount of bass.. 2). Build quality - Build quality of the product is exceptionally great for this price and it has two magnets which holds the ear pieces in place.. 3). Sweat proof - Suitable for gym freaks.

Charging time takes around 45 minutes to reach 100%. CONS:. 1). Connectivity - Bluetooth range is not that great. After moving 5 meters away from the device, the connectivity gets lost. So, mostly make sure that you carry your mobile along with you and the battery information about the device is not appropriate. Some times it shows 80% in my device and all of a sudden it indicates 20% battery remaining.. 2). Tactility - Buttons on this headphones are not that easy to press.

Overall design is good and you can wear them whole day if you can avoid that shark fin holders😅. Button position is also good and easy to operate.. 2. Battery life. While you are connected to phone either you are using the Neckband or not. It consumes some power continuously and last for 9-10 hours.. 3. Noise isolation. I use earphones generally while traveling. I found that I have to increase the volume to maximum while in Metro. And this is not great because listing to full volume for a long time can damage your ears.. 4. Charging. It does support the fast charging. You can enjoy your Neckband again after 1.5hours of full charging.. 5.cVc technology. This technology is used for making clear voice calls while you are in a crowded area. It works pretty well but if the noices are too much it wouldn't help you either.. 6. Sound quality. Music I'm getting over it good. Thumping bass is not available but yes good overall.. Treble level is good so the vocals and high frequencies can be listen greatly.. Don't expect same sound quality in traffic area as noise isolation is not great that much.. Overall it is a good product and that's why rated 3 starts.. Hope it will help you 😇.

Reviewed in India on 21 August 2020,Kaushik Majumdar,Best value for money in the budget headphone space.,"Sound quality: The bass is overpowering. It is distinct but suppresses the highs quite a bit. You're not going to enjoy this if you aren't a definite basshead. Truthfully speaking, the boAt 100s come the closest to a flat sound signature. However, the overpowering bass in the 255s are nothing a bit of EQ can't fix. When idle and resuming, an audible hiss can be heard which I think is the noise floor of the headset. This is a problem with most budget Bluetooth headphones as I've experienced and nothing can be done to mitigate it.. Design and build quality: The wings provide a snug fit but then the headphones can't be worn as quickly. Removing the wings makes you really feel the weight of the buds. The length of the wires, however, can't be adjusted and it can be a pain if it doesn't suit you that well.. Battery: Optimal performance as described until now. Lasts me 2 whole days since I mostly keep it at idle and don't like listening to music at more than 40-50% of volume. However, the battery falls down from 60% to 20% abrupt within an hour of use, and at 20%, you get that annoying ""Oops, low battery"" voice alert every minute which ruins the experience so much that you can't use it anymore.. Bluetooth: Connectivity and range is robust (10-12m before signal deterioration). If you're having connection issues, it is probably due to interference with WiFi as both WiFi and Bluetooth use 2.4 GHz band. You can mitigate this by switching your WiFi band router to 5 GHz though this will consume more power. Bluetooth multi-connect is supported and you can connect your laptop and phone at the same time to listen through your laptop and attend to calls through the phone.

Reviewed in India on 8 September 2019,Anand Thukral,Reasonable earphones for the price- but have a short life span seemingly..,"Wrote a much longer review but the page reset so I am not re-typing- The bass was good (bass lovers might enjoy it..) but a bit too high/heavy for my liking and so it tends to drown out/reduce the clarity of other instruments and the vocals at times too. Similar to the MDR and XB Sony ranges as far as the bass and overall output goes. The battery life is decent at about 6 hours listening at 70-80% + of the max volume. The wireless range was also decent and can be put at approximately 15 feet max - but with say two walls in between (so it might be a little more minus the walls..). The magnetic lock seems to work just fine, have not really tested the microphone much- the widened neckband is great and gives the earphones stability on the neck. My main issue came down to the life span of the product- I thought the build quality and durability was above average but then this happened- Bought this a few months ago but I left it pretty much sealed and untouched in its box (I continued to use my Apple and Skullcandy wired earphones-the sound quality on the Apple pods is still brilliant so I still use the wired ones over wireless earphones whenever possible/not too inconvenient) - so I only started to use the Boat earphones a month or two ago and well- the left earpiece is already malfunctioning and had almost stopped outputting any audible sound on a few occasions now. I did tend to use the earphones at 80% plus of the max volume but if that is the cause for failure then the earphones obviously are not engineered as well as claimed. Now the volume of the left earpiece is softer and less clear than the right- and has faded away completely on occasions that I have tried to listen to music for a stretch of about 4 hours on 80% volume or such- I am just trying to keep the volume low at the moment so that the earpiece does not stop emitting sound completely again- will have no choice but to get in touch with their customer service if the issue persists and see what they say- but the only conclusion I can draw from my experience thus far is that these earphones lack even say Skullcandy's durability which at least use to last almost a year even when used for long stretches of time at about 80-90% of the upper volume limit for music etc.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I am quite surprised why reviewers have not said anything about this.. If you want to listen to songs or calls at low volume. This is not the best, ready to get bothered by consistent hissing sound.. 2)if you like to run or jog while listening to songs, this one is definitely not for you, since the movement of band will cause lot of noise disturbance while running and will annoy you. Its ok if you want to just sit and listen.. 3). I don't find the fitting very comfortable, it seem claustrophobic to be. Ears started to pain after 30 minutes or so. Boat needs to work on design of earpiece to make it more comfortable.. 4)sound quality is not as Supreme as marketed in reviews etc. The lows are very poor. Bass comes to effect after mid ranges. Overall not a very soothing experience in terms of listening.. Pros. ------. Build quality is good.. Wires look string and premium and buttons looks of good quality plastic.. 2)bluetooth range is good, no issues encountered while moving from one room to another.. 3)there is a battery symbol displayed on phone, so you get to know the charge level..

Reviewed in India on 18 June 2020,Srobona Chakraborty,Good at what it does!,"This bluetooth headset is a nice one. After almost 1.5 years of usage, it is still doing a great job.. The box contained the boAt Rockers and three pairs of ear-tips ranging from small to large size.. The battery life is not amazing but it can suffice for a full working day with a lot of calls and streaming internet content. Battery is still in good shape.. It shows battery percentage in multiples of 20. For example, after 100%, it will show 80% directly. No issues with that.. The bluetooth range is decent. It tends to disconnect when the device it is connected to is say, a room away.. The microphone quality is also decent because no one complained about it.. It is certainly not the absolute best in terms of audio quality. This department is highly subjective but, a pure, neutral sound cannot be expected because of the emphasized bass which I enjoyed. The mid-tones and the high-tones tend to get muffled a little bit but then, that's what we must expect from any earphone that has added bass to it. It is definitely enjoyable.. There exists latency but it's negligible. One might not notice it unless exclusive attention is paid to the same.. If you want that added bass and neutral sound isn't your cup of tea, you can check it out!. Noise cancellation doesn't make a major difference because the ear-tips are in-ear style.. However, it has a micro-USB port that it uses to charge.. However, with the likes of Realme Wireless Buds, OnePlus Z and Oppo Enco in the market, this is not the best buy but it's still a good buy if you're very tight on budget. But 1.5 years ago, it was definitely a great buy.. Cheers!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 19 January 2020,Vallabha Sayar,Decent pair BT earphones under 2k,"I'll break down my review into 4 parts : Sound quality, noise cancellation and calls(mic), battery and ergonomics. Sound quality:. For the price range of 1.2k, ( I got it for 900 rupees during 2019 Dasara sale ) the quality of sound is pretty crisp. There is a slight overtone to Bass while the other elements are balanced. Personally, I think this balance is perfect. Given the pricing, I'd rate 5/5 for sound quality.. Noise cancellation:. For the pricing range, I'd say the noise cancellation is pretty decent. Somewhere close to half volume your noise cancellation works seamlessly while listening to music. On the other hand, when I'm on calls, the noise cancellation is pretty poor. People often tell me that they're clearly able to listen to all the talk and noise and honking etc, from the background but not my voice. So I have to pull the mic closer to my lips to be audible enough to eliminate background noise. So, I'd give 3/5 for noise cancellation.. Battery:. I play music at a pretty low volumes (some 3 button presses lower than half volume) So, the battery can easily last upto 6 hrs. If I'm watching a movie or TV series, it'll last for 7-8 hours. The charging time is pretty nominal. I charge it from 6:45 am to 8:15 am and it would have gone from 0 to full charge. You could charge it with a 2.1 A adapter for a much quicker charge but I don't know if the earphones can handle that current without getting damaged in the long run (read the institution manual). So, at this pricing, I'd give battery a 4/5. Ergonomics:. I must say, my favourite part is the magnetic lock. It's convenient and you can simply wear it around your neck like a necklace. It's easy to tuck it under your collar and keep it locked when not using. Looks sturdy though I don't wish to test it ! One disadvantage would be that that wire is a little too long and that wasn't necessary. It's bulky and unlike other BT earphones, you can't throw them in a bag, you'll need to be careful where you put it. If the ear hooks are positioned correctly, you should have no pain around the ear cartilage while wearing them for long durations. I wear it 2.5 hrs a day to work and I rarely feel irritated or pain around the ear. So, I'd give ergonomics and overall comfort a 3/5. Combining the ratings for all the above mentioned parameters, the overall eating turns out to be a 4/5 for this pricing which is pretty decent I'd say. Whenever it's on offer (under 1000 bucks) and you want a pair of BT earphones, simply go for it. I can absolutely vouch for it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 2 June 2020,Rohit,Amazing product at affordable cost,"Writing review after 4 months of usage.. Instant connectivity, however i find the power on and off voice notification irritating.. Charging and charge hold is good. Gives 3 hours approx. talktime in 20 mind charge. I found this useful. Full charge gives atleast 6 hours of usage (used it more than couple of times when watching series).. Noise cancellation is good, voice clarity is nice loud and clear, however is sometimes bassy like the person from other end is talking in a hall., Maybe something to do with the network.. Music is above average. Had given 5 stars for music and bass but after 2 months of usage i found the volume drop i.e. even when setting the volume level at it highest level, the output is not that heavy as it was in first two months. Though checked all my phone settings, nothing has changed.. Bluetooth connectivity, and range is seamless and fantastic.. Overall a good product at the price offered.

Reviewed in India on 4 September 2019,Vishal Vaidya,An honest review after a month - Overall a true value for money,"Well, I have been using these for a month now and the earphones are really good. The sound quality is immensely saturated. I could figure out the bass, treble and other modules separately. The bass is good for people who are not audiophiles. Like if you're not into sound recording or need minute details to grab onto, its perfect for you. I grabbed the deal in 1k though, so it was a nerve cracking deal for me. The battery lasts for 5 to 6 hrs for me even if I stay connected to the phone via Bluetooth without playing any music. It lacks the backup if I keep using it for listening to music for an hour or so and lasts for about 4.5 hrs or so. Mic quality is kinda okay clear but it catches too much of sounds of around you which can irritate the person on the other line.

Reviewed in India on 27 March 2021,Azhar Maulavi,Budget friendly good for casual use.,"So it's been some time I've been using these about a month I guess, and I can say I'm fully content with these, sound quality is good, they are durable, light in weight, fit in ear just there, bass is a bit overrated but I think for me it's ok, voice on call clear enough. So overall a good make all in all, find the below review to check out and decide if these fit your specs for a perfect buy.. So when you unbox these quite a good box and you can see through the plastic covering the headphones, once you open the box you'll find some docs such as the warranty card, and the boat pamphlet, and some other doc's related to boat.. Make - I think the make seems to be quite good in this price, when I wore them for the first time I couldn't feel the headphones around my neck then, they've just managed to make them light but still heavy enough to sustain around your neck, you'll find less buttons and the best part for me is that they have provided a C-type charging socket which was just a Cherry on the cake for me as I possess a One plus. They've taken care that it doesn't get itchy around your neck and also you keep enjoying your music experience so great work on that front, the wires are a bit long coz they are connected to the end of the heavy plastic material, and I'm afraid I might just pop off one the wires if my activities are a bit aggressive, so I hope they work on that part, the erabuds fit okay in the ear I can feel a heaviness in ear when I wear, them, plus the smallest of the rubber tips just seem the medium size to me maybe because of the external part being bigger in size than the internal part that goes in-ear. So I'm not satisfied with the earbud part that goes in-ear but all in all I think they've done a pretty good job to provide the best quality in this price range.. Music and call quality - On the music front I think they've done a decent job, the earphones a loud and packed with extra bass, now what happens is if you are connected and you get a call it just bangs in-ear which could be dangerous if your phone ring volume is full, they are just too loud so it's difficult to guage other music fronts and beats, as far the bass is concerned it's just wow if you're listening to bass packed music. So if you are looking for that detailed music breakdown it's a heartbreak there, and I also happen to get a lag for about .1 or .2 seconds which means gamers I won't recommend these to you, but if you're just looking for casual use I think you can just go for it.. Noise cancellation - Actually people have misunderstood the noise cancellation funda in these, so there is no extra feature or a button where you press and get the Noise cancellation mode active, so then what does it mean, whatever they have advertised that is partly correct yes it has noise cancellation but not that at par, it does a pretty decent job though, if you're wearing these then you might wanna press them into your ear to get better results for the noise cancellation part.. Price - I got these in a sale price of ₹1499 on Amazon, so I feel that's a great buy in such a budget, the original price appears to be ₹1999 however you'll find them at ₹1700 - ₹1800 on Flipkart, do remember to check your prices before you buys these.. All in all a wonderful product if you're engaged in calls, and casual browsing and streaming videos online, good enough for listening to music, I would suggest a best buy budget friendly.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I am an occasional user of that.. But I wanted something for my commute and I was looking for something wireless and with in ear buds to go with my 1+6T. I found these for 1k during the recent sale. Here are my initial impressions. 1. The sound signature is very very bassy. You need to use an EQ to bring it to your liking. Try listening to a song that has a heavy beat or bass played high to experience your tolerance levels.. 2. If you use a One Plus 6 or newer phone, go into the audio tuner option in settings and set the 'Sound Enhancement' option to 'One Plus Bullets Wireless's and the EQ preset to 'Pop'. This should balance out the bass and it surprisingly alleviated the mid tones.. 3. Pairing was east. Long press the middle button and put your phone on blue tooth discovery mode.. 5. Sweat resistance and durability is something I have to wait and watch as this is just initial days. But looking at the construction quality, I think it should be ok.. 6. Call Quality - not checked. But I don't intend to use it to take too many calls anyway.. Verdict: Good for 1k but not worth more. in fact paying more than 1k and buying something for listening music falls into the audiophile category. For that, you should really invest in an established brand like Bose or Sennheiser.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.. The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.. I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.. Everyone should give them a try once..

The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.. I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not.

Reviewed in India on 4 July 2020,Anurup Chakraborty,Best Budget Friendly Wireless Bluetooth Earphone,"If you are looking for a pocket friendly bluetooth wirelss earphone with a decent sound quality, this product from Boat could be a good choice for you. I purchased it @ INR 999 during the great amazon sale (usually available @ INR 1499). I am writing this review after using the product for 6 months.. First let us talk about the features that the company highlights with my comment on it:. -- Super Extra Bass - I would not completely agree with this claim although I would say that it has a good bass (Plus I personally do not prefer too much of bass). -- Water and Sweat Resistance - It is definitely sweat resistant and I can claim that as I use it while working. The sound quality is not disturbed with sweat; but not very sure with its water resistant claim. I have been out in light drizzle with this ON; the sound quality did not get affected in the first 10 min, but then it got a little bad. I would not advise to try any stunt with this pocket friendly earphone ;). -- Sound Quality - I would rate it above average. Cannot expect anything better in this range.. Now, I would want to mention a few more pointers that I look at in an earphone:. -- Noise Cancellation - Not that great with noise cancellation. There are 2 aspects to it. One, the unwanted noise is not passed through the mike. Second, while you are using it, you are not hearing others around you. It provides partial noise cancellation in the second scenario. -- How it fits in the ear - Could have been better ergonomically designed. The each support may come out at times and this is the only part where I thought Boat could have done better even at this budget.. -- Buttons - Honestly, I do not use it to receive or end phone calls too often, but it works fine to receive calls and adjust the volume. The buttons are on the right side and very conveniently placed.. -- How it feels to use it- The product is to be worn around your neck and is very comfortable. although the wire length from the shoulder to the ears is a little long and could have been shorter.. I am using this earphone regularly for the past 6 months and have bought one more to gift my sister too. If you have a limited budget, like I did, you can go ahead with this. It is surely one of the better products available in this price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars

PROS:. 1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.. Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.. Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.. Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.. 2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.. 3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.. 4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.. 5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.. 6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.. 7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.. 8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.. 9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.. CONS:. 1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.. 2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.. 3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.. Final words:. Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly.. Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphonest clear comparetively to jbl or sony .",4.0 out of 5 stars

Bluetooth range is poor - Disturbance even with a 10ft distance. 2. Multiple device support is bad - This is no longer a fancy feature. It is much needed. This device cannot connect and disconnect seamlessly.. 3. On/off switch is weird - Sometimes the device is on and even after a long press of 30 seconds it doesn't switch off and doesn't connect to a device either.. 4. Hanging magnet - I do not understand why all BT earphones in India follow this design. Mpow Jaws has a brilliant design where the earphones have a slot in the neckband where they stick when not in use instead of dangling near the chest. Mpow Jaws is expensive in India but is cheap in the US where I used them for 4 years straight.. Wish that companies like Boat can replicate such a simple technology and design in India as well.,2.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 15 November 2019,Amazon Customer,Quality compromised however model name is same,"This is my 2nd boat rockerz 255.

The 2nd One which i purchased 2 weeks ago seems having the same model number but the quality has definately been downgraded, the branding on back of the earpiece has also got washed out in 2 weeks.

The people who had the old make and has the new make aswell will definately understand what i am saying. When connected to bluetooth the old one said ""you r now connected to boat rockerz 255"" however the new one says ""you r now connected to boat rockerz"" this is one of the difference aswell..

Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.. Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.. Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.. Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.. 2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.. 3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.. 4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.. 5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.. 6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.. 7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.. 8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.. 9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.. CONS:. 1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.. 2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.. 3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.. Final words:.

Dual connect feature is unique and awesome. You can connect on laptop as well as your phone at the same time. You can pause audio/video in one device and play in other device. Band is flexible which increases it's durability. While Sony offers better Bluetooth earphones at higher prices with longer battery life it lacks this flexibility. Noise cancellation does not work properly. If you are travelling and speaking on a call the other person will understand that you are travelling which is not the case with Sony earphones.

Bluetooth is perfect. 4. Battery backup is almost 3 hours. But why I am not recommending u to buy this, here are reasons. 1. Its durability is just 4 to 5 months. After 4 to 5 months one or both side earphone stop working. 2. It holds 1 year warranty but if u want to claim ur warranty, it is tedious process. They pick up ur headphone, but they didnt give it back within 1 month. They take more than a month to give back ur headphone. Furthermore, U need to call them a number of time for getting ur product back. Also, they are very rude to talk with us. They give u the product back only if u call them again and again, if not forget about the headphone.. Personal experience:. My one side speaker stop working after 5 months, then i request them for a warranty. They collect my headphone, but they took abot 1.5 months to return and this is even when I call them again and again. When I got the new headphone, they again last for just 3 months and now they are not working.

Reviewed in India on 13 May 2019,Nausheer,Good buy at an affordable price,I was looking for a pair of bluetooth earphones to use during my gym workouts and I found these for Rs. 999 during a sale event. Here's my review after 1 week of using this product -. Pros:. 1) Excellent bass quality. You'll love these earphones if you are a bass lover.. 2) The earphones are lightweight and the magnetic tip makes it easy to carry around neck. I find them really convenient to use at the gym. 3) Good noise cancellation & sweat resistant.. Cons:. Battery life - boAt claims a battery life of 6 hours but these run out much before that. It shuts down even though my phone displays 20% battery left. Ear pain - The ear buds are not the most comfortable pair you can find. My ears start hurting after prolonged usage. Mic - The voice quality is not that great and not preferred for taking calls.. Overall it's a good buy for the price range.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 16 August 2019,Amazon Customer,Good pair of Bluetooth earphone however not useful for RUNNING. And cannot be Stored in any case.,"Disclaimer: This is big detailed review.. Bluetooth Earphones are of good quality. Sweat and water-resistant. Charging time is ~40 minutes. Works for 4-5 hours use straight. And can be on standby mode for 6-8 hours. Hence overall covers 10-14 hours usage initially if you are migrating from good pain of wired earphone like jbl cs100si or scheniser CX180 you will feel its sound somewhat different with extra base. However, you can control sound profile using installing Equilizer app from play store.. However, one thing is important this is not that much suitable for runners. When I start running with them its neckband and battery unit starts oscillating over my neck. Earbuds remain fix on ears due to the extensions provided with it however this neckband and battery units are not at all that much stable.. So if you are planning to use these for day to day use then this is great Bluetooth earphone. But if you are trying to pair them while running then this is not at all a suitable match.. In addition, the design is such that after wearing them around neck cables creates a sharp bend near the battery unit which is a matter of concern and can cause Bluetooth Earphones to go bad in short time.. I almost forgot about keys provided on the neckband. These are great, tactile and highly responsive. Google Assistant also works flawlessly with the help of them. Range wise if you are in the same room around 10-12 feets distant from mobile then these earphones works best. After that, if you increase distance further or change room and go to the next room some glitches in sound occurs.. I almost forgot about one thing the storage for these earphones. It is very difficult to store them in any container or box as compared to any other wired earphone which you can wrap and place in any box or pouch. Hence as you cannot wound it you have to always wear them on the neck. No other option, you cannot just slip them in the last pocket of your backpack as this can cause harms to cables. This is almost annoying for me every time.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I purchased this to find something good in budget but it came out to be total waste. Guys if you are looking for something good in wireless, try to increase your budget a little bit higher. You will definitely find something good.. The mic is the worst. I'd give it a 1/5. There is zero noise cancellation. The person hearing your voice can barely tolerate it. Do not get this product if you are gonna use it for calling as well. You even have to use voice chat at the time of gaming and it gets really annoying for them.. The feel of product is decent. But the wire is incredibly long, feels weird while wearing it.. I have attached images, i have used an A4 sheet for size reference.. You can't wear it for longer time. The earpiece is huge and bulky. If you wear it more than an hour, it starts paining. It's not really comfortable plus it's made up of metal, it is a bit heavy.. It looses connection often or you hear distortion/breakage of sound when you are traveling. You have to keep your device very close to you otherwise the sounds start breaking. You can't even use it across the room.. It doesn't really have a good bass, the bass is okayish; 3/5. You can play around with equalizer to get a slight bass, other than that, it doesn't really have any bass considering it has 10mm drivers and that ""super extra bass"".. The battery was fine until it reached 50-60%. The rest drained within 10 minutes of usage. It charges quickly though.. I recieved a small charging cable and 2 pairs of earbuds (image).

Not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.. The ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use, however this makes each ear piece heavier, as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds, they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece.

Reviewed in India on 2 July 2019,Aneek Sanyal,Conquers the competition...,"Build: Well designed, lightweight and comfortable. The wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than Mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boAt in the 1499 price category).. Comfort: As mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). They're lightweight, so no hazard on that department. Perfect for long hours of music playback.. Sound: The most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boAt surely doesn't disappoint here as well. A bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. Good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. Although, judging from a pure audiophile's point of view, the Mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boAt, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or Bollywood genres. A music player with a good equalizer (preferably Poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.. Battery: A single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.. Verdict: In a nutshell, boAt Rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. With it's better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it's competition. For the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars

BUT, If you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.. Lows (bass) is SO POWERFUL. Rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. Their only focus was on the bass. These earphones have extra bass.. (i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass).
