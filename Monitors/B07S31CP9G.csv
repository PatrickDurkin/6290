Its good lookinh the picture quality is good (note: purchase it if are going to game all day long. Don't buy it if you are going to watch movies and all) The refresh rate is good.

Reviewed in India on 24 September 2019,ROY,FreeSync Isn't Working With VRB and Incomplete specification(Best product Under 9K price),"Gaming:-. Buy this monitor for gaming if you don't care about your eyes. To achieve 1ms (measured 1.7ms MPRT though it isn't mentioned in specification whether it is GTG or MPRT) response time it uses VRB. Which is a new technique to reduce response time by strobing back-light and that makes eye strain.. Other than Gaming:-. It has a response time of 12.7ms without VRB. And watching movie also a horrible experience. YouTube, NetFlix and Watching movie isn't recommended according to my experience.. Real Bad thing:-. What I was not expected from this price point of VA panel Monitor is ""Color banding problem"". It happens to lower color bit depth of monitor and in specification nothing mention about bit depth or color bit. At windows display settings it shows 8-bit but appears like 6-bit. By ignoring this problem color performance is very good, exceptional color performance for VA panel.. Good thing:-. The Black Level which is very Impressive. No back-light bleeding of panel glowing like IPS panel. Black are real rich black. I watched some HDR sample from YouTube which was amazing. Color is really good and should not have any major issue with professional work.. I bought this for the black level. I tried off of IPS glow and Gray Black.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 24 June 2020,Amazon Customer,No Display port 😞  (Didn't realise the difference before buying),"EDIT: I was really happy with this monitor only after a month, I have realized how screwed my MacBook's battery life is after using this on HDMI. Apparently, if you use an HDMI, Macbook's graphic card kicks in and HDMI pulls images at a full refresh rate, even though nothing has changed on the display. Display port pulls images only when the image actually changes.. Now my Macbook's battery life has gone from 10 hrs to 3 hrs on battery. Can't return my monitor now.. 😞. I use it for work and sit really close to the monitor, so I use it at the least brightness. I saw little backlight bleeding web the black correction was set to 5 / 10. After I set that to 0 as well, no bleeding whatsoever! (Basically, the backlight is off 😅). In other scenarios, there's a little backlight bleeding, as expected from LCD screens.. This is really important for reading text as backlight bleeding will make it difficult to read the text on your screen. #programmer 😅.

Reviewed in India on 7 February 2020,Alex,Comparision with Samsung 27inch LC27F390 for gaming,"I had the Samsung monitor up until a month ago. Then I moved cities and couldn't carry the Samsung with me because its rod seems impossible to dis-assemble. This monitor is easier to disassemble. I use these monitors for ps4 gaming, so my review would be based around that.. Picture quality: Firstly having a curved Samsung monitor makes no difference. Your eyes will not see any difference once you are immersed. It is easy to set a desirable picture quality on the Samsung, but this Acer monitor has many different options. So one has to really fiddle around to get desirable picture quality. After setting 50% blue light and Ultra Sharpness, I do believe I am getting much better gaming picture quality than on the Samsung monitor.. Weight: The Acer monitor is quite bulky. It is literally twice the weight of the samsung monitor. The Samsung monitor is lightweight and can even be placed on one's bed. The Acer needs a table.. Design: Unlike the Samsung, this Acer monitor is not curved, but it looks more premium due to its bezel design and V shaped stand.. Ports: This Acer monitor has 2 HDMI ports and a VGA port. The HDMI ports can switch automatically based on which input is powered on. I would have liked a audio out port like the Samsung had.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 24 June 2020,Pseudo T.,Not spectacular in any fashion.,"Nothing much to write home about. The ghosting is an overblown issue in my opinion. In case you're affected by it, you clearly have a rig capable of running things at 75Hz in which case you can afford a better monitor. The blacks (after tweaking) aren't even deep as a smartphone IPS but way better than my TN laptop. I wonder how worse it would've been with an IPS monitor when most reviews talk of blacks being great on this machine. Then there is banding, which makes things even sadder. The viewing angle is sub-par. Even viewed from the front, there is this ugly gamma gradient which shows up real bad on a grey screen (note they aren't as bad as in the photos - duh, cameras vs eyes). The cons aren't a deal breaker only because I work mostly on the command line. Though a part of me died on opening Blender and I've resorted to a pure black theme to compensate. So if you're a non-fps gamer who doesn't play games with plain grey scenes, then it'd be okay. Otherwise go for something better. Really, shell some money on a good monitor because this is a once-in-years purchase and you'll regret it.. TLDR: Decent blacks. Ugly gamma shift. Color banding. Not much ghosting as some reviews say.. EDIT: The gamma shift issue seems to affect all VA panels. Thus not a product specific issue per se. There's also current (AC) leaking via the HDMI ports.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 19 May 2020,Aryan Sharma,"An excellent ""Gaming"" monitor, emphasis only on Gaming.","Quoting ""Gaming"" in the title might seem redundant but it's far from it. This is not a mockery of the claim of the seller, the monitor is in reality an excellent gaming monitor and there are no doubts about that. As mentioned in some of the prior reviews, that the product they received had some defect in them like dead pixels, a crack here, etc., so the first thing I did was checked for any faults so I could raise a replacement request straight away, but thankfully it didn't come to it.. It is difficult to find a monitor this big at the price at which it is offered. I suppose the manufacturer was able to cut costs by using a VA panel instead of an IPS one. There's a lot of confusion related to the panels, but the most relevant points to care about are:. 1.) IPS Panels have a better viewing angle. This doesn't mean that the VA has bad viewing angles, actually far from it, it's just that it's not on par with IPS. Besides, if you're buying a monitor, a fair assumption would be that you'd view it sitting in front of it, so the viewing angles aren't really important. I checked the monitor from different angles and it looks fine to me.. 2.) VA panels have better contrast ratio ergo better picture quality and better blacks compared to IPS panels. Pictures with a dark background are viewed much better on VA panels so that's a bonus as well.. I'd like to highlight some of the things I liked and some minor gripes.. What I liked:. 1.) Screen Size: This monitor is huge, I don't know what I was expecting when I bought this, but definitely not what I'm seeing right now. It's almost on the verge of the TV territory especially from up close. Prepared to be treated with delight playing on this. It would definitely be hard to go back to a smaller screen size after getting used to this mammoth of a screen.. 2.) Picture Quality: The Picture quality is phenomenal. I'm basing this after playing a couple of games on a PS4 (I bought this to play my PS4 on). I don't know much about the technicalities, the images in the draw distance are clear, the closeups are very detailed, there is no motion blur or choppiness in fast paced scenes, the response time is good and the gameplay is fluid. I tested both games running on 30 and 60 FPS. It's such a shame that a majority of the games are clocked at 30FPS on a PS4 so I can't really see the true power of this monitor, but oh well, I'd get a PC soon and then we can see.. Some Minor Gripes:. 1.) I wish the monitor was height adjustable. It's tilt adjustable so that's good. I have a chair where I can adjust the height and recline so it's not much of a problem for me personally.. 2.) Out of the Box settings are quite bad. The Gamma is set to 2.2 which should be 2.4, the temperature is warm which you would want to change to Normal and Cool, depending on your preference. Calibration is required to find your fit. I haven't calibrated mine but plan to do so. Downloading the Acer Desktop Widget app is a pretty cool way instead of fiddling with the buttons.. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase. The picture quality when using as a regular monitor is not as crisp as I have seen on other monitors smaller in size (It makes sense because the pixel density in a big monitor would be lower), but none of that matters when you load up a game on it because there are absolutely no compromises there.",5.0 out of 5 stars
