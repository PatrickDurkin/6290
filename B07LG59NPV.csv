The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.. Additional features :. These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating.

But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.. Sound quality :. Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.. The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base..

Reviewed in India on 24 January 2019,Prabhat Ranjan Kumar,Two major issues,"Two major issues: 1) Bluetooth connection stability: this device connects instantly but while on the move the audio is constantly interrupted. Even if I keep my hand on the pocket the phone is kept, it interrupts audio (while walking). And not only for few seconds, but it keep on interrupting through out my walk. If I'm using it with the phone in front of me it's awesome, but not at all good while walking.. 2) Direction of sound: It lacks a very fundamental concept of direction of sound. Left earpiece produces sound coming from right and vice versa. First I had doubt, while playing game. Later on checked using 5d sound test and now confirmed that both earpiece produces sound coming from opposite direction. Left earpiece produces sound coming from right and Right earpiece produces sound coming from left.. Used this device for approximately a week.. I am writing this review after I placed a replace request. I would try the replaced set and if the issue remains same, I would like a refund.. Received the replacement and found same issue with the replaced set too.. Update: I requested a refund of the replaced product.

Reviewed in India on 4 April 2019,Krish,Guys pls don't get fooled up by more number of positive reviews,"Very bad to start with cons as I don't find any single pros. Cons:. - Battery Draining Too quickly, Within 1hr call at volume level 80, battery drastically dropped from 100 to 80.. - Sound distorting when we walk or riding a bike or when we stand near traffic.. - Left side ear tip keep on falling, not a perfect fit.. - Vibration is very cheap as a Chinese phone. - i don't think noise cancellation is there in this device. even in a quiet environment, its too noisy at the other end of the phone call.. - Manufacturer not mentioned anything about ip rating and water resistance in the box or manual. but seller posting wrong information in the listing. i have even checked with boult audio website, there is no evidence about water resistance.. - no bass at all. even treble is not calibrated rightly sound is too shrilling.. - Too Light, it will fly away when you ride a motorcycle with this Boult Audio Curve. I had used Soundpeats Q900 and Samsung Level U in my past. Soundpeats have top class experience, Samsung reasonably a good alternative.

Reviewed in India on 28 January 2019,Vivek,Good product but average sound quality and horrible after sales support!,"The best part about this product was the ease it brought in my life. I literally wore it entire day and even during workout as it settles down around the neck quite easily.. The battery backup has been good so far in 3 months of usage. 12+ hours of usage in one full charge. Looks decent, not very premium but sturdy and is comfortable to wear. Fits snugly in the ear. The sound quality is clear and crisp.. About the cons, it is not really for an audiophile as it has hardly any bass. Noise cancellation could have been better but it is still decent. As many have mentioned, the connection gets distorted in a crowd or when I move 10+ feet away from the phone.. Edit - The ear plug on the left side has come out after 2 months of use and they have not given any replacement. Recently I have discovered that the after sales support for this product is non-existent. The customer care helpline never responds and I have called 100 times.

Very annoying vibration feature - the neckband rattles whenever a call comes, making you regret buying this, they shouldn't have bothered with that vibration feature, it's ridiculous, the build quality of the switches is not that good, feels very cheap, looks okay but feels cheap.. Power saving feature - there are other neckbands which you connect and leave, if the connection is lost and later you come close to the neckband it will get connected again immediately, but this one gets switched off automatically if the connection is off, and the connection can go off very easily in this, so you have to keep switching on and connecting this back.

Reviewed in India on 26 July 2019,Sharath,Good Design | 3-Star Sound Quality | No Bass,"Pros:. 1. Good design. Wire is folded backwards - preventing wire shorting problem due to bends.. 2. Wire length adjuster provided. 3. Most important - longest stable bluetooth range which didn't break with 2 concrete wall in between. I have tried portronics and boat and their BT starts breaking at mere 2 meters; and gets worse with use for some reason.. 4. Charging port location is well placed - makes easy to insert the charging pin. Cons:. 1. No bass. If you are a bass lover, you will not like it.. 2. Buttons are not tactile. When you move your fingers on buttons, you can't be sure if you found the right button. 3. Finish is not as stylish and good as portronics or boat. It feels plasticky and the buttons shake in their sockets. While portronics or boat have smooth rubberized finish with raise tactile buttons.. Conclusion:. If you want BASS or overall superior audio quality - go for Portronics Harmonics 208. If you want a long lasting product with reliable BT range and if you are okay with a little compromise in BASS and sound quality, you can go for BOULT. Boat has less BASS and sound quality compared to Portronics, but is better than BOULT. The only plus I found with Boat is its good quality design and buttons. Sound quality is average.. I finally settled for BOULT because it was the only product properly working (BT range & battery life) after 15 days of use. I really liked Portronics, but what's the use of good audio if the product is just going to last for a month. So I choose a better lasting one with a little compromise on audio quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 13 November 2020,Amazon Customer,Genuine review after returning pTron Tangent Plus and Boat Rockerz 255 pro,"Everything is good for this neckband and I really liked it over Boat and pTron.. 1. Sound quality - Loudness is best in Boat, followed by Boult CurvePro and last is pTron. But sound quality if you want all tones, best is CurvePro no doubt!!. 2. Range - Its best in pTron, followed by CurvePro and last is Boat Rockerz 255 Pro. 3. Connectivity - I felt Boat is best on usability as once the power is on it automatically connects, same with pTron. But for CurvePro you have to press the power button for some time till you hear ready to pair or connecting, this to me sometimes bit confusing. pTron also doesn't have that problem but pTron doesn't have ""dual pairing"", which other two supports perfectly.. 4. Consistency - I didn't get any drop or connection issues with pTron & CurvePro. But Boat was pathetic to me with frequent loss for fraction of seconds during skype meetings from Laptop, or jogging.. 5. Build quality - All are plastics but Boat is best, followed by pTron and last CurvePro.. 6. Comfort - I felt boat earplugs are heavy and can't wear for long time, for me this is worst and deal breaker. Moreover Boat doesn't have proper fitting neckband, very loose and wires are hanging in the front without control so very bad experience. If you are running or gymming this should be your last option. pTron is better than Boat but still have this issue to some extent. For this, CurvePro is ""unbeatable"" and I really liked their low weight, light ear plugs (though size could have been a little small).. 7. Battery - Boat is worst, really mean it! hardly 4-5 hrs so irritating to charge frequently as you have to open charging plug, connect the short charging wire in the middle of a call. Another deal-breaker for me. Both pTron & CurvePro are really great >12 hrs. CurvePro has faster charging too, so thumbs up for that!!. 8. Call Quality - Boat is again a deal-breaker for me. If you want to use for casual calling please forget it. My old mono and cheap bluetooth have better quality than this. Not a single call I had without getting a request to repeat or louder tone from other end. pTron call quality is also good, but best among these three are CurvePro. Though not tested in crowded and noisy areas with either of them.. Overall - To me except build quality, Boat is the distant loser, and not sure why such hype for this!! I can live with pTron Tangent Plus also considering its price point, but if the budget is around INR 1200, I will recommend Boult CurvePro, no doubt - better and compact fit, controllable wire length, dual pairing, batter battery charging.. Note: I don't know about the ""durability"" or ""Service"" as it's hardly a week of experience!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

The audio from the earbuds is quite crisp and clear even at the higher levels. I was expecting some bass also from the product but it is not there still you can enjoy songs if you are not that inclined to bassy sounds (trying some equalizer settings might do some help, but on my moto g9 power even the equaliser settings dint change the sound much).. Coming to portability it is delightful, owing to its less weight and ergonomic earbuds. The rubber placeholders provided with the earplugs ensure that the plugs stay in the ear holes without even getting too close to the eardrums. The wire although slim (less durable in comparison to the Boat ones) does a good job and the clips provided along with the headphone manage the length of the cords which I think is the best feature in this product.. The battery life is acceptable, it gets charged in around 1-1.2 hours and stays with you for around the whole official day..

Been using it primarily to listen to music and audio books. Serving that purpose very well indeed. Consistently getting 11+ hrs of playback. Takes about an hr to fully charge.

Features that I like. 1. Vibration alerts for calls. (Very helpful). 2. Bluetooth 5.0. 3. Decent battery life for 2 days use.. 4. Good range (Bluetooth 5.0 feature). 5. Decent sound quality. (For calling). 6. Can work with 2 devices connected without any issues.. Only thing I can complain about is sound quality while listening to Music. but then its priced at Rs. 1000. To overcome this problem I have downloaded 3rd party equalizer on my android phone.. I initially faced issues with Mic but it was phone(Redmi Note 9) software issue. After updating phone software the issue was gone.. Ear buds are comfortable and dont fall off the ears because of the additional grip.. Magnets on the eardbus are just for keeping the keeping the earbuds together and they do not pause the music.. The design of neckband is excellent as it is very lightweight and you can shorten the lenght of wire and they will not hang.. If Boult provides an App for managing the sound & connections then it would be a great great deal.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 7 October 2019,Dr Arnab Roy,Satisfied with product,"For those who are reading reviews and watching youtube videos comparing this Bluetooth earphone with others, here are my observations and experimental suggestions:. 1. First thing first, once you receive this set, connect it to your saved mp3 songs (no streaming), bit rate 192 kbps or more preferably 320.. 2. Then change the earbuds that came with the set to one size bigger, use Sony or Sennheiser or Boat buds if you have any of those.. 3. Connect and listen to same songs again. I am confident you will experience the difference for the better.. 4. Now a bit of technical observation: the response range of this product is actually 22 Hz to 14 kHz. What it means is that- it has brilliant bass response, better than even Sony or Boat, but poor treble response.. 5. Because of the balance tilted towards the low frequencies the sound is warm, clarity is average and treble is muffled.. You will like its signature if you like to songs like say Ghungroo or Bang Bang or Kala Chasma, but not Saki Saki (both bass and treble heavy). Also old world songs will not sound very clear unless remastered.. Bluetooth 5.0 works well, enabling it to stay connected with phone all the time and have a better battery life. Vibration feature has been omitted though.. Quality of materials is acceptable and the way wires can be extended/shortened is brilliant. All in all at this price it's a steal.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 27 October 2020,Amit Gupta,Its between 3 and 4 stars but doesn't touch 4,"Note - Some Harshita from Boult Audio called me and influenced me to write this review in return of a reward of 200 in my paytm wallet. I have given my genuine review but now they have not given any reward. So do not write any feedback if you are writing for the reward.. The main reason I bought it was its design. Specifically, the adjustable length of wires. I wanted it mainly for calls and not for music. Calls quality is good. Mic is not catching distant sounds which is usually an issue with wireless headphones, but not with this.. From audio perspective - bass is not that great as advertised. Just OK. Noise cancellation is also not very good. Not good for music listeners.. From design perspective - its not true that you can wear it all day long. Actually you start feeling it on your neck in some time. Especially if both earbuds are connected through magnet and hanging on your neck. I wish I had bought curve pro which is way lighter than this.. Packing and Delivery - Initially I got a damaged packing with used and dirty headset which I got replaced. The new packing that I got also had re-sealed box with tampered seal below it. I accepted anyway. User manual was missing from the box.. The model I got has volume up button below and volume down button up (see image). This doesn't make any sense. Also, double clicking on power does not dial last called number. Double clicking was working in the model that I got in the damaged box which I got replaced.. Overall I am satisfied because it does the job for me which is audio calling.",2.0 out of 5 stars

You can get a clear audio ouput in both call and songs/movies even at high volume, without any disturbance.

The connectivity range is ~7 meters,after which audio starts to break.. Though no earclip is present, the buds will fit comfortably in the ear. As the wire length adjustment is possible, looks cool without any wire dangling on the side.....with magnets provided in the buds. So buds can be locked when not fitted in ear.. As for the battery backup, though I haven't fully depleted it, the charge dropped to 70% from 100% after 3-4 hours of continuous use (songs/movie). And took ~30 mins to fully charge from 40%.. Waterproof tested with buds cleaned with water without submerging it... No problems found..

CAN'T EVEN REGISTER A COMPLAINT. WASTAGE OR MONEY.. OLDER REVIEW: Writing after 1 months of usage. The band length is a bit small. There are 3 pairs of the earbud covers and a small charging wire provided. the feature of closing the wires on the band is an excellent feature! It is more comfortable to wear and even sleep wearing it than the Boat ones. The sound quality is good, but Boat is better in this department. Bass is good and pleasant. However, if you want a higher Bass experience, go for Boat. The mike and noise cancellation during calls is better than Boat. It has its own volume regulation independent of your phone/PC settings. So, when you are listening and can't hear, increase your earphone and then regulate your phone/PC volume. The connection to Bluetooth is very easy on phone and PC. The earphones come charged. So, can use directly. Overall, a decent product.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Fits very nicely in the ear and neck band is also very light with soft outing, so you won't feel a thing on your neck. Boult is a very good company for audio based on my personal exp.. The only point where it lacks a bit is the bluetooth range. Don't get me wrong. It's still very good when the phone is in your pocket and you won't face any issues.

Thinking of the price, I think it's an okay product and is a much better buy than any other product at this price range.. 3. Sound Quality is adequate, there are some hollow sounds at times.. bass sounds cheap, treble sounds cheap, overall audio is good but doesn't hits the spot where it can put you at peace. But thinking of the price point, it's amazing. Finally, and for those that hear at low volumes won't really enjoy it.. it's more focused on the people who enjoy listening at high volumes, so you can happily forget listening to jazz in it.. 4. My previous earphone were *nu Jaxx*, it had one of the best sound quality in the audio department but it's biggest losses were, it's mere 1Hr battery, and very low range, less than 1m. So had to buy, something better.. 5. Build Quality seems okay, the tactile button seems a bit fragile and sometime don't take input. There is no manual pairing button, therefore it will always broadcast itself , something to think about for privacy concerns.. 6. My only worry, is the overly fragile wire that goes in the earbuds, it's too thin, too small, and in no way seems that it can withstand much of torture, specially if you are one of those that travel in mumbai trains.. 7.

Reviewed in India on 17 June 2019,Gyan Dixit,!!!Amazing product!!!,"Alright. So I have been using Boult ProBass Curve for over a month and would like to summarize my feedback in bullet-points to make it easy for the prospective buyers. I was thinking to buy a quality Bluetooth headset with a great performance at an affordable price for quite long and this is where my search ended. I was quite fed up of using cheap wired headsets as they used to go out of function or get snapped every now and then. Moreover, I found them getting entangled every other second making it really inconvenient to handle especially while travelling. Its that time I started feeling the need of a wireless headset and began my search. I took good time (months) to look for a good product. And, this is when I decided to purchase this item. Before purchase I devoted time to read the user's reviews (that I always do before making any purchase-small or big) and found myself convinced. Finally, I decided to go for it. Ok. So, no more essay writing :) Let me get straight to the key points:. 1. I bought this for 999 under Sale so saved INR 499. (it's a good saving. As Warrent Buffet says ""every penny saved is every penny earned""). 2. This has great sound quality. I could not compare it against any other product because I don't have any other bluetooth headset with me :) But this will surely not let you down. It is very loud even at 80% volume level. You just cannot listen to at that level; forget about full volume. Bass is great but not outstanding to be honest but it does not disappoint either. Good thing is the sound does not distort even if you raise it to 100%. Excellent sound clarity!. 3. I am not a technocrat so cannot tell what are the characteristics of noise cancellation feature but you will not get to hear any external sound/noise or very very minimal that is not noticeable. So, this stands perfect at this point.. 4. Performs excellent while taking a call. You will a get a crystal clear voice when you make/take a call using this device. You will feel as if you are making calls directly from the mobile phone. In fact, it's even better at times when the voice from the other side is low. I really love the hands-free calling because I have to take long calls with the clients in my job.. 5. Battery backup is excellent!!! It can last anywhere from 10 to 11 hours. I have tested it rigorously in both audio and video usage. And, I mean it. I tested it for almost a month with day-wise log capture. Please see the detailed tracking at the end. It gets full charged in 2 hours approx.. 6. Bluetooth range is good. It covers a distance of 10 to 15 feet easily. It's quite enough if not good enough. My figures may be wrong. Beware! It's just my rough estimate. Haven't tested is rigorously.. 7. Design looks good and is very convenient to wear. The wires are adjustable as per need. This is a nice thing. Looks cool when you wear it around your neck. I chose Red color.. 8. Last but not the least. It comes with 1 year replacement warranty so you can sleep peacefully while enjoying your favorite music :). Judgement: Just go for it if you have a limited budget or don't want to spend a fortune on bluetooth headset. I was hesitant to spend anything beyond 1000 bucks on a bluetooth headset. It was my personal limitation..

Reviewed in India on 5 September 2020,Lakshya Saklecha,An earphone recommended for the price below Rs. 1500.,"With smartphones becoming highly sought after gadgets in the Indian home, similar demand for affordable earbuds has also followed suit. And there‚Äôs nothing harder than choosing between a pair of earphones as the market is chock full of options. ¬†It's quite easy to end up with a pair that doesn't have good fit or sound quality or battery life.. Ideally, the best earphones should offer good in-ear comfort and fit even with long sessions, great sound quality of course, and good battery life. Keeping that in mind, I've been using these newly purchased ""Boult Audio ProBass Curve Wireless"" for a week now and here is my review for the same. *Rating* : 4.5 out of 5. Usage:. After using the earphones for the past week, I've noticed next to none issues with the product. The audio received from the bluetooth wireless is crisp and clear and at full volume, it is clear and does nor distort.. *While Gaming*: While playing games like PUBG, FreeFire, COD:Mobile and many more multiplayer games using these earphones, I've never once felt any lag or distortion. They are an amazing pair to be used while gaming.. Battery:. I am using this earphones as I am writing this review and it has been connected to my phone for the past 5 hours and is still showing 50% battery remaining. I've used it to binge watch shows as well as for intense gaming sessions and also for music while doing other chores and I am glad to say that these wireless earphones handled my usage like a beast. I am getting an average of 10 hours of backup per day for the past week and I am satisfied with it. Also, the charging is fast and helps you get through the day with an hour of charge.. Pros:. + Good Sound Quality. + No lags or distortion during gaming or watching movies. + Nice Battery Backup (8+ hours of constant use). + Light Weight. + Easy to use. Cons:. - Sometimes, on one of my phones, the headset sometimes disconnected randomly. However, they worked like a charm on reconnecting. I could not find what caused the issue but this is what I experienced.. In conclusion, the headphones are a great fit withing the budget. There may be many headphones with competetive prices and features but I found these better than within the range of Rs. 1500 range..

Reviewed in India on 7 December 2020,K Bandyopadhyay,No Replacement for a Newly Purchased Defective Product,"I had ordered this product on November 9, 2020, and received the same on November 11, 2020. However, it being a gift for a friend of mine, I didn't test if the device was working or not (to keep the packaging untampered). Having received it on 23rd November 2020, my friend discovered that the mic was not functional. Since the return window closed on November 18, 2020, Amazon was not ready to help me with the refund or replacement procedure, despite my Prime membership and this being a ""Prime Fulfilled"" product.. Nevertheless, keeping in view the one-year warranty on this neckband I communicated with Boult Audio over e-mail (they do not respond over the phone) and demanded a replacement or refund. Accordingly, the defective neckband was couriered from my end on November 28, 2020, via DTDC and on December 5, 2020, I received a parcel from Boult Audio containing the repaired neckband (not a replacement) in a transparent pouch placed inside a black cardboard box (instead of the original Booult Audio packaging), a charging cable and two additional rubber tips and silicon ear loops. This time, there was no trace of the user manual or warranty card received during my purchase from Amazon.. Now, I wanted to make sure that this time my friend is handed over the earphone in good working condition and went on to test the same. In this process, I discovered that though the mic is working just fine, after using the neckband for about 1.5hrs, the blue light starts flashing and this interferes with some of the functions like ""play/pause"" music, ""play next/previous track"" etc. At this point, if I switch off the neckband and put it on charge for some time, it again works normally for 1.5 hrs, following which the same problem recurs. However, restarting the neckband or re-pairing it with some other device (other than the one with which it was hitherto paired) in response to the blinking blue light, prompts an almost glitch-free functioning, though the blue light keeps on blinking. Now this bothers me because I am totally in the dark as to what the flashing blue light implies and how to deal with it.. I communicated the same to the support team on December 6, 2020, only to find my mail remaining unanswered till the moment I am submitting this review.. Keeping in mind the company goodwill, they should have replaced (which I demanded from the very beginning of my communication with their support team), instead of repairing the defective neckband when its a newly purchased product and within the warranty period as well. Even if it is repaired, the same should be sent to the customer with all the items in the original package (viz. neckband earphone, charging cable, user manual, warranty card and extra rubber ear tips and earloops). But this company didn't bother to send the third and fourth items (user manual and warranty card) and that too without offering any explanation for the same.. This had been my first ever purchase from Boult Audio as also of a Bluetooth neckband. But unfortunately, the experience would serve as a lesson for me to think twice before purchasing any Boult Audio product, let alone recommending the same to my friends and family.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Glad to find out they've kept the quality of sound, excellent noise cancellation and deep punchy bass in this revised product.. Listing out some of my observations between the two :. *The older version had a vibration motor, newer model doesn't because of certain issues related to health they say. I personally loved the vibration feature though but I appreciate the company being a little health conscious too.. *The cables connecting the speakers in the older model were made of some wrinkle free flexible rubber like material which seemed very soft but delicate. The newer model seems to have stronger cables but it does wrinkle. I hope the coating won't wear off like the older one.. *Acoustics feels almost no difference.. Still the best I've used in this price segment so far.. Hard to mention the details as I've just got the product last night!I'll need some time to dwell into the details and will let you all know if I've found anything good or bad... Based on my previous experience the only problem with this product was the delicate cable and the speaker cap getting off because of improper functioning of the glue maybe.

Reviewed in India on 17 October 2020,GURUSWAMY G,Do not expect much,"Just bought it. Things I dislike:. 1. The wire connecting the earphone to the neckband is thin and flimsy. I do not expect it to last 1 year. Not sure whether I can use the 1 year warranty for that. I wear this in such a way that the thin wire starts from the back of the neck to my ear. I believe that's how most people wear it if you do not want to have dangling wires, and that orientation needs this thin wire to have a 60 degree bend like a 'V' at the back of the neck. The build qulity and design is sub-par.. 2. Speaking of design, the 'R' symbol (to indicate right-hand side) is upside down. 3. Have to keep the PC volume or mobile volume high for the sound to be comfortably audible. In other earphones the PC volume is at 30% and I'm good. For this one, the volume has to be at 80%.. Otherwise it is fine. But nobody is going to buy it at it's unslashed price of 4.5k lol. One has to think hard to even buy it for 1000/-. If it lasts one year, I'd feel okay.

Now I'm updating my review about Boult audio pro bass curve after using a week. #This headphone is over all good. *Built quality is also good. *Battery life is approximately 9-10 hr. *Sound quality is also good and better than previous version but one whenever you are DJ sound with full of bass then you feel the realistic bass pressure. *Wire quality is average but better than the previous version. Rating from my side is 8/10,5.0 out of 5 stars

After using 10 days continuesly reviewing this unit. At first impression it looks premium & decent.. Review is as follow :. 1. Battery Life ----. It has 1-2 days stand by time.. => It runs 8-10 hours if you r a moderate user.. => It long lasts for 20-25 hours, if U r a normal user.. It takes 2 - 2¬Ω hours to get fully charged.. 2. Sound Quality----. No doubt it has Punchy & Deep Bass with Balanced Treble, Surrounding Effect. You can feel/listen lows,mids,highs very clearly. Call quality is also good with mic but noise cancellation need some improvement.. 3. Built Quality----. Built quality is very decent & looks premium. Physical buttons on left-side are very light to press. Neckband is made with some good quality of plastic so that it is very flexible. U can sleep evenafter wearing it. Earbuds r also soft. Wire quality is also nice for long lasting.. 4. Connectivity----. Company said it works in 10 meters of range but as per personal experience it has some connectivity issues. Connection breaks if u r walking/ jogging. Connection also disturb if u r walking through one room to another even having distance less than 5 meters... So the conclusion is:. You can go for it with this price range bcoz it has all the qualities mixture. Buy it if u r Deep bass lover. Long lasting battery life.. It's sturdy & water resistant. It's not bulky also as it has wire adjutable hooks/lock both side, u can adjust wire length by this.. Overall ranking 4 out of 5 bcoz some connectivity issues r there.",5.0 out of 5 stars

In the first time, even though I found the earphones to be good in the first hour, only after some of listening, it started aching severely in my ears. Moreover, I simultaneously tried other earphones which didn't. Moreover, a couple of days into use, these earphones started having connectivity issues. Out of nowhere, even though it showed connected, it played the media on my speakers, that's the most pathetic thing to happen. Imagine having a private business with this pair of earphones and it blasts out on the speaker out of nowhere. Moreover, the connectivity had issues, I had to power it on/off again and again to connect. Apart from this, the buttons had poor functionality and we're looking obviously cheap build.. Now, the horror, my replacement issues. I agreed for replacing the product. I got the replacement. It was so bad since the moment I opened the box. The earbuds had TRACES OF EARWAX. DISGUSTING. And it also gave up evidences of a refurbished product. I tried to get over it by changing my earbuds (took me a lot of convincing). I tried, the earache persisted, however, with more problems. The connectivity was so bad, I was barely 4 metres away with a wall in between, it worked in a terrible condition. Listening to music became an absolute nightmare. Apart from that, the buttons work only after a second or third attempt and give vibes of a cheap build quality. The only good thing was the battery life, maybe because I barely used it for more than an hour.

Secondly, the primary reason to purchase a wireless headset or earphones is convenience, which lacks at times with these earphones, owing to a very limited range and instances of lingo while listening to your choice of music (even when the phone is in your pocket). Overall, for the price, these are a good buy, despite it's shortcomings.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 11 February 2021,Joseph Cherian,A good product at this price,"I would definitely recommend this product at the price it is sold at. Good sound quality. Ample bass, not damping the sound, enhances the overall quality. A major merit is the battery life, I could easily get around 12-14 hrs. It's humongous in terms of battery. A gripe would be that it tends to sound less on the left earpiece or tends to sound more on the right earpiece, can clearly distinguish the volume difference in both the earpiece (maybe only in my product). Also, a little more bass would have been a perfect finishing touch for this product. All in all, I like this product very much.. Edit - No noise cancellation at all.

I have purchased it for 900/- INR during Amazon Sale Day. It is completely handsfree and able to attend the calls conveniently.. One good benefit is if you are facing any mobile network issue in your house.. Just place your mobile near window or where ever you receive good signal strength and rest mobile communicates with your earphone via bluetooth. You can attend the call from any nearest room in your house without call distortion [but only up to certain meters]. Design --> Excellent. Built Quality --> Excellent. Call Quality via bluetooth --> Good [Very negligible distortion but not always]. Ear buds --> easy to fasten in the ear without any discomfort.. Music & Songs via Bluetooth --> Excellent bass quality with noise cancellation. FM radio --> plugin any other wired earphone jack to your mobile and hear the song in boult earphone via bluetooth. Not very much pleasing. You will hear lot of distraction while listening songs from FM radio.. Battery life --> Excellent. I have tested it continuously only for 8 hours and it works perfectly.. GPS Navigation --> Very helpful. You can listen to google maps navigation voice especially while riding two wheeler.. Earphone Vibration --> Excellent. It vibrates when you receive the calls.

This is the better choice to make.,This is a 4 days usage review.. *Coming from a wired headphones that's why I felt the bass was a little lacking but not absent. It is still good.. * The call clarity is really good. No issues with that.. * Audio quality is good too. All voices in songs are very clear and distinct. No distortion or anything sort of yet.. * Built quality is good.. * The thing which I loved the most about this product is the passive noise cancellation. It is really very good. Completely felt isolated from surrounding noise.. * The only thing which I disliked is the Bluetooth range. It is not very great. And my only reason for giving it a 4 star.. Although I might increase the rating after a few months if I find the battery life as good as it is now.. *The battery life is great.

Audion Video sync is good. Clear sound. 3. Battery backup. Though the company claims of 10 hours, it gives around 5-6 hours heavy ussage (continuous music and voice call) if the battery is 100% charged.. 4. Good packing by Amazon. Provides 1 year warranty and 2 extra pairs of ear buds.. 5. Magnetic ear pieces. So that it does not get loose from your neck.. Cons. 1. Built quality not so good. The bend is off flexible plastic. The wire is too thin. Seems cheap quality material is used. Can be torned anytime if proper care not taken.. Buttons are not so good quality. May damage soon if you use it continuously. So use your phone's volume rocker/call receiving buttons.. 2. Company claims of high bass, but bass is not that good. If your phone is high end, the music is good but other wise you ll miss the bass part. Treble is high. You may need to do some manual setting in your phone to get the best output.. 3. Bluetooth range is not that good. Can be good if you use it in one room. If you go to another room it will give you hicups. I used it in my balcony and my phone was in the room, I found the connectivity is not so good. You can use it within max 10 feet radius without any wall or solid obstacle.. So this is it. As I said at this price range I really can't complain or find any cons. So if you are looking for a Rs1000-1200 range Bluetooth band. Go for it.

Reviewed in India on 3 July 2019,SGS,These headphones are designed to annoy you... buy something else.,"Let's face it: these are cheap headphones meant to used for exercising, commuting, etc. If you're an audiophile, you aren't getting these to really hear the vocal range of your favorite Mozart opera. The audio is fine for listening to a podcast or talking on the phone on your way to work. But compared to similarly cheap Skullcandy headphones I have had in the past, these headphones feel like they were designed to annoy you. First, the bluetooth connection drops pretty easily. Even if the distance from headphone to your phone is from your head to your pocket. Second, the battery life is pretty bad too. It will start giving you an annoying voiced warning saying battery life is low even when there is 40% left; and it will die within 2 or 3 mins from when the warning starts. Finally - and this is the worst - there is a vibration 'feature' that is truly awful. If the head phones get out of range of the connected device, it doesn't just gracefully let you know and disconnect. No. It just keeps buzzing/vibrating and drives you to distraction. Suppose you are connected to your laptop and phone. Then you get a phone call and walk away from your laptop to receive it. Well guess what, the headphones start buzzing/vibrating in the middle of your call because they are now out of range of the laptop. Jeez. Just miserable! It even does this buzzing when you turn it on and off. In the end, and even at the cost of losing the money I paid for these headphones, it was worth it to just smash these headphones with a hammer and be rid of them and that horrible buzzing.
