Reviewed in India on 10 September 2019,Fitnessinfinity,Just red hot,"A quick honest review.. Wanted a portable earphones alternate to my big headphones which sometimes gives pain to ears after constant use so thought of getting earphones as having earphones and headphones at same time is like getting better from both the world's.. Design - red variant have killer color design.. Sound- very nice even at lowest volume, you can still hear it nicely.. Bass- justify at this price range.. Treble- just equivalent to bass magnitude.. What I felt is that in this earphones bass and treble goes hand by hand , none of the one has edge over other which makes it perfect for me. Both are complimentary to each other, perfectly match.. What I didn't liked is in ear design, it pains sometimes, comes with different sizes of ear buds and rings too so you have to see which one fits perfectly.. Overall at this price range it's worth it, definitely go for it.. Edit: it's 24 September 2020, more than a year and it's still delivering music without any issues. Moreover I have purchased many earphones in between ,some in ear and some headphones, but this is still working while many have encountered issues. I have used this while riding bike under heavy rain so it's also immune to rain, mic wasn't very good from the beginning as it should not be for a calling purpose. Music is really good, seeing its overall built quality and thick wires,it's pretty obvious that that's why it still working perfectly fine without any issues.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 4 June 2020,Abhishek jawharkar,Value for money,"Its Good Overall.. I previously used Sennheiser CX180 ,skulls and Audiotechnica.. Ordered Boult because I thought this is in my budget, got it for 450/- (you can get a better deal). Looks - looks super premium.. Feel - it's bulky, long wires. Looks sturdy and should last. It's shipped with small eartips and other option is too bigger. I feel is not the very comfortable earphones to wear but it's not very bad. It has wings which holds it pretty much in place.. Sound - sound wise its really something good, it feels it has good depth to it . It's not at all bass centric. Trust me you don't need heavy bass to dominate your music. I found it very good for psychedelic music it's does a good job but not the best and can't be compared to CX 180. Noise cancellation is best in class if you use smaller eartips. Again, lows mids and Highs are perfect , im not pro but I judge how well my techno music sounds.. I guess I will like it more as I use it more and it gets through sound burn.. Gaming - Really good for gaming , PUBG is good though again footsteps are very legible but there is room for improvement. Call quality is good.. Verdict - Value for money. If budget permits go for Sennheiser.. Yes this is made in china , I don't know how I feel about it. And it's 999/- on mrp so the deal I got is good.

Reviewed in India on 17 August 2020,GOUTAM G.,Wireless version not so great,"First of all I like to mention so huge numbers of reviews you see the products are actually for wired version. It was lauched during Prime day sale in first week of August, 2020 and already with 2200 reviews.. I had a good impression in Boult before I purchased this one.. The have done a trick by listing both wired and wireless version together on Amazon which I believe grossly wrong.. Moreover, they have mentioned battery life at one place as 12hr (headline), elsewhere as 16hrs (product description), but the real thing is on the product pack.. Clearly mentioned as 8hrs (see photo). It is simply cheating.. Now coming to the other aspects:. The sound quality is good and you have to choice the right ear gel. Here another limitation, though they have packed ear gel of 3 different sizes, the rubber hook is only single set, you can't replace.. Bass quality is not that good by native, have to use an equaliser to get desired effect. Mid and high are okay.. Yes it is dual pairing.. No bluetooth version revealed.. Not the driver size as well, checking the size, I could guess it's in 9-10mm range.. The wire length is also small (avoid if you have a heavy and wider neck, it won't fit you) and does not seat properly on neck, the left capsule on the wire which houses battery is heavier and wire shifts to that side resulting in asymmetric position (mic and in line control panel capsule that is on the right side, gets away from your mouth)..so not useful for work out sessions.. Now the battery life: it struggles to get 7hr life in fully charged, even at 50% volume. Most annoying part is that once you reach 30% it will continually say 'battery low' every 61 sec. And believe me it will drop to 10% in 10 min.. Good thing it Supports AptX and HDAC codecs, you have to tweak with developers option on few mobile sets (mine Redmi Note 6 Pro).. No product specifications are available either on pack or manual, which is really bad, this changes my impression for Boult. This is typically a Chinese product marketed in India.. Soundwise it is okaish, but if you want to have a good back up go for something else.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Sound Quality - These earphones are really good and loud. Don't judge as soon as you hear the first song when it gets delivered, play 3-4 songs on full volume and let the speaker warm up, then u will realise the actual sound of it. And actually I am not even able to use the maximum volume as it is really high.. Noise Cancellation - I would say excellent.... I don't hear any back ground noise neither inside nor outside. So I would say it meet the requirements preety well.. Bass - Really high... And I am not a bass lover so I had to use the equalizer to make it at as per my need and then it's provides awesome sound. Though most of us don't use equalizer but please do.. Build Quality - Very Good.... It does not look cheap and looks durable and classy. Best part it does not fall of the ears.. Value for Money - I got it for 899 though after listening to the sound I can pay around 1000 as well.. Battery Backup - It says 12 hours but trust me I don't have that kind of time to test it In fact most of us would use it in a day for may be 4-5 hours. So it fulfill the needs.. Connectivity - I read a lot of reviews before buying but people talk about latency... I don't understand.... U turn on the blue tooth in ur phone.... Turn on the earphone and in next 1 sec it's connected. So people who complain about latency may be testing it in nano or micro second that is not needed for me. I am happy with 1 sec..

Nowhere the specifications of the earphones are mentioned by the manufacturer, probably to avoid competition among their own products.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 11 November 2020,Kakali Chatterjee,Not bad......not at all..... it's a bang bro!!,"Okay so I really had to think a lot before buying these buds......and I gradually thought that what can I get in just 389? And really, I was blown right away when the product reached me. It's not that good though, but it's not worse too. I've seen many buds that claim to be good at the same price....or sometimes maybe above the price. But these are just dang good!. Yeah it's right that the company had to make some sacrifice to make a good-sounding product like this, so I just want to share what I liked about the Boult Audio X1-. 1. First of all, the price. I mean 389 is high though, but if you want a good product which can stand strong and sound like bang on, this is really a great choice. The sound is absolutely great, the base is so high you can actually feel the buds vibrating a bit due to the bass. And it is actually more good if you have a dts or dolby digital or atmos subscription, it really gives more clarity and bass depth.. 2. The all metal construction with a gold plated headphone jack is such a A+ thing to see in this price. I mean, there are a lot of buds that do have metal body, but are not durable at all. But this one is an A+ construction.. 3. The noise cancellation, is really good. You can actually feel that cancellation happening. Although you need to note that if you opt for the small eartip, it might vary but the large eartip does more of a good job than the smaller one.. 4. The wire is matt like rubber which is honestly a sturdy option for such a budget. I mean, yeah a kevlar or cloth type wire would make a difference in durability, but still it actually feels durable in hand and I think it can bear with my day to day rough usage......I will probably update what's the condition, so might be helpful for some.. 5. The original packaging is very good and actually does a good job of protecting the buds.. Obviously, I can't just keep on talking about all the goodies.....there are some minus points, some of which are terrible things to have in this earbuds. Let me just talk about those things too-. 1. First of all, what is this connector? It is not a right angled(90‚Å∞) connector, it's like...umm.....a little bit more than 90‚Å∞, it is like 105‚Å∞ connector or something. Which makes it uncomfortable. Specially if you try to keep it inside your pocket, you might have to adjust the connector to actually fit your device in. Personally, I am not a huge fan of this design.. 2. The free ear holder rings are somewhat ok. I mean they do the job pretty good, but it is not of the correct size. The large one' s are not large enough and the small one's are actually medium one's.....which is quite confusing. But it's just a very minor thing. Much minor than the connector. 3. The sound is no doubt a bang, but when you are listening to a bass+high pitched song, it tends to lower the vocals and tries to boost the bass a lot. At first, I thought it was my phone that was doing this, but no it's the earbuds. This won't affect a lot of your music hearing and I think some might not even notice this.....not at all. But as a regular user of buds, I feel they could have tuned the drivers to be a little aggresive in high pitched songs. 4. Altough I said that the wire is good. But need to mention, it's rubber, and it will break someday. So not a good choice too.. But overall I liked it alot. It might be because of the price, might be.....but still for average person, gamers, it will be just an awesome budget buds. And if I had to score the buds according to each of it's section, here they are:-. Sound quality 9/10. Sound volume 10/10. Bass 10/10. Treble 10/10. Design 100/10(I really lyk it :-) ). In ear experience 8/10. Ear rings 7/10. Ear tips 8/10. And that's it, if you found this review helpful pls do vote(might make me popular :-P )",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 29 August 2020,Sourabh Raj,"False advertisement, decent sound quality, average cord","Once you buy it people are gonna.swarm you with texts and calls to ask you to give a good review and give stars. They would lure you with a 100 rupees reward. But you are not going to receive any. Atleast I didn't. The moment I dropped my review, they stopped responding to my texts. So I am going to give you an honest review. Other reviews might have been affected by the 100 rupees ruse. So don't believe all the five stars.. I would have liked a longer cord, there's really nothing special about the cord. Mine especially had a pin point where the coating was eroded and you could see the aluminium. You get a gold plated L jack which looks cool and is practical. You don't get magnetic buds if that's what you thought when you looked at the metallic finish. That's definitely a con on my book. There are no volume control buttons. The buds are comfortable and and have a decent sound quality FOR ITS PRICE. You get passive noise cancellation, which experienced headphone users know is malarkey for product advertisement. It in the ear so yeah it reduces the amplitude of the surrounding noise. The thing I found really disturbing is, I don't know if it happens with everyone or if it's just me. But when I connected it to my tablet, I noticed it during a zoom meeting that even if my mic is muted, the headset mic continues to look for the surrounding sound. When you scratch against the smart button, you notice you can hear the screeching sound. I looked, but there's no settings to disable and enable mic. So it just keeps on operating even when you're not using it. Other than it's a decent product in this price range. Overall I would say that you either expand your price range or take this slightly above average product. It's not bad, but there's really nothing that sets it apart.

I purchased the ""Blue-Black"" color variant and received it a couple of days back. The company packages the earphones in a cute little box with a Warranty Registration card in it. I opened the packing and was greeted to stunning and premium looking Boult X1 Earphones. So sporty, so amazing and when I put it on, the angled ear plugs fit snug into my ears. Very ergonomically designed. Even the ear tips are so soft and the product also comes with attached set of rubber fins to make the earphones fit snugly into your ears. They also give you 3 additional sets of ear tips and ear fins , all of varying sizes to fit different ear sizes , to make every user feel comfortable when using Boult X1. You can run or exercise without worrying that your earphones would fall off. Coming to the sound quality of the earphones ..I must say ..It's crystal clear and the Instrument separation is great. Vocals are clear too. Treble is good and Bass is adequate. Bass will not be so thumping so as to overpower the song or the words spoken in a video or audio etc.. These earphones give you rich , adequate bass to help you enjoy music without that bang bang bang bass of other earphones that gives you a headache. Boult X1 has a well balanced Sound signature.. The earphone mic quality is absolutely amazing and I called atleast 3 different people in different states of India to test this on different mobile networks and everybody said that my voice was crystal clear.. Noise cancellation is just ok. We can hear outside sounds when we plug in these earphones too. However lower noise cancellation is in a way a safety feature too, as it may help you hear outside sounds of vehicles etc ... when you are walking or jogging alongside the road listening to music using these earphones.. Coming to warranty... Registration of warranty was a breeze too. It took me just 2 mins to register my earphone on boult.com website and I received a confirmation mail instantly, stating my product is now registered successfully under 1 year of Warranty.. In summary... Boult X1 is one of the Best sounding , economically priced and premium looking earphones in India. Anyone can buy this without a second thought.

Price : got it for 329 rs. Can't get a better deal. Overall - 9/10. Base - 7/10. Treble 8. 5/10. Noise cancellation 9/10. Price 10/10. And I'm going to briefly compare the above on the following. Packing - a simple box. No frills. Has diff sizes buds and ear support buds. Which is a bonus. No warranty card though.. Cable quality and longevity - all of my jbl headphones have worked around 13-15 months max, with the exception of the jbl 150 csi going for around 18 months. The sennheiser(thinnest wires though) lasted me 2.5 years though. Can't say about these, but the cable quality is better than all the above branded headphones. Lets see how long they last.. Sound - well well! Didn't expect this coming from Boult and at this price but the sound quality is great . Good bass(not too high, balanced) , treble and noise cancellation. Handle high volumes really well as well.. For the price, I'd say its exceptional. Its better than the jbl Csi series and considering you almost double the money. Though can't beat the Sennhieser cx 180 street. Its is the best in this segment in terms of sound but the major downside with the. Cx 180 is no mic. Which is why I gave it a pass.. The only con I would say is the headphones are somewhat thick and will cause discomfort while lying down on the side and watching movies or listening to music..

Reviewed in India on 21 September 2020,Vishal,Worth buying.  Amazing Product.,I have bought this earphone on July 29th.. After one and half month I am writing this review.. Pros: this earphone is comparatively good than Boat. This earphone has the ear holder which provides flexibility to hold this earphone better than boat basic.. 2. The jack which goes to cellphone is very intelligently designed in such a way that I do not have to remove cellphone cover.. 3. At this Price range I would tell it is better than boat due to its holding grip on ear.. 4. Decent sound quality as it does not make pitch high and does not become irritating for increasing sound.. Cons:. 1. This ear phone wire is round rather than flat. However this is not a cons but need to handle with care. Boat has flat wire high gives more robust.,5.0 out of 5 stars
