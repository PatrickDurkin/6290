Reviewed in India on 12 January 2020,Ramprasad,Decent earphones for the price,"This is my third Bluetooth neckband, I own a House of Marley, a Realme Bud and this one. A brief comparison on some key parameters and a short review of this one.. Battery: The Realme does standout, lasts much longer than the other two, charging too is quite fast, the Infinity Glide came fully charged and dropped to 80% with about 60 minutes of usage, at this rate I guess it may last for just about 5-6 hours at the most. Charging is reasonably fast.. Comfort: This is pretty light and comfortable, the wires connecting the buds are not as stiff as the realme ones, the original earbuds fit perfectly and caused no pain or discomfort, the band round the neck too is comfortable, better than the Realme and the House of Marley. All three come with extra pairs of buds. Fits well and does not pop out while jogging or walking, the same holds for the other two devices compared as well.. Sound quality: The house of Marley was good while it lasted, alas, the Right bud stopped working after two years. The Realme too is good, though I found the highs missing in a few popular songs. The Infinity Glide is just about ok, the bass is present, but I found the highs missing, and some songs, thought the vocals sounded a bit dull (sort of muffled), but tastes differ. House of Marley was the best followed by the Realme, this one would just be ok for me. Both the Realme and the Glide had no noticeable lag when playing videos.. Features: The Realme feature of connecting and disconnecting using the magnetic buds was awesome, no such feature exists in Glide. The Glide though has a small cover to close the USB charging slot, the Realme has no such cover. The Glide has a BT 5.0, while the others don't, I found the connection strong even with a wall in between. The Dual EQ usage was a bit difficult, simultaneous pressing of the two-volume buttons cumbersome and the Bluetooth kept getting disconnected, also the phone had to be reconnected to the earphone each time the earphone was powered on, this I found to be seamless in Realme. The track change is a long press in the Glide, needs time to get used to this as I ended up increasing the volume several times while changing the track. The Glide is supposed to be splash-proof, though I have not tried this.. Call quality: Realme beats the other two hands down on this. House of Marley was the worst. If one uses the earphone for calling as a primary purpose, the Realme should be a better option.. Looks and Feel: Realme looks premium, followed by the Marley earphone. The Glide has the infinity symbol on the buds flat outer surface, while the Realme does not even sport a logo. I would put Realme on top of the list.. Durability: The House of Marley earphones lasted just about two years, the Realme is about three months old, and going strong, need to see how long the Infinity Glide lasts.. Verdict: If the difference of 500Rs between the Realme and the Glide is not very significant, I would recommend the Realme. But if 500Rs is a big difference, then the Glide is pretty functional, decent sound and comfort, my only concern would be the battery, 5-6 hours is all that I think it could give on first use, while the Realme gave me 8 hours easily on one charge. I guess the disconnect feature while not in use comes in handy for the Realme.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 17 February 2020,Manish,Talking about audio quality.,"** I just wanted to save your time so, pubg people & mic quality people this review ain't for you. This review focuses basically on the audio quality part.. So, giving you guys a little background about me, I'm a musician and as you can see in the images I've used two wired headphones alongside this wireless headphone for comparison.. Left - Audio Technica CLR 100BK. Middle - Sennheiser CX 213. Right - Infinity Glide 120. Now I've always chosen Sennheiser basically as they don't color any particular zone of the sonic spectrum; if you're a flat sound lover you basically know what I'm talking about. Also, Audio Technica comes somewhere nearby; just a lil bit of color in the low end to provide that 'oomph' or the thump & subtle reduction of the highs, more of a thumpy festival sound.. Now coming to Infinity, this guy doesn't seem to reproduce the high end at all, don't know if I 'burn-in' these earphones hoping the sound quality will improve a bit.. I basically wanted a wireless upgrade without causing a hole in my pocket for the rest of the month; so gave this a try.. * Well, the extra bass tag is no special, don't be fooled. Low - 10/10. Mids - 9/10. Highs - 5/10. Still testing the battery, will update this review after couple of days.. ** Forgot to update, battery wasn't special too, returned the item.

Reviewed in India on 14 October 2020,Koushik Nath,Not worth buying becasue of two reasons - JBL's packaging & JBL's support over such issues,I had to return this product and get a refund for no technical issue but rather callous decisions by JBL over its packaging and its effect on the product ergonomics.

Reviewed in India on 20 November 2020,Debabrata Bahadur,Disappointed.,"I was very excited about this, Because Harman International is very well known brand in world of Accoustic. Bought it for Rs 1199/- Got today. Here some pros and cons of this device.. Pros:. ● Good build quality.. ● IPX5, splash proof. Not water proof.. ● Comfortable.. ● Fit to ear.. ● Decent battery back up.. ● tangle free cable.. ● easy to carry.. ● very lightweight.. ● flexible.. ● No issues while calling.. ● Noise cancellation works well.. Cons:. ◆ Sound quality average. Lack of details. In high volume it just makes noise. Excessive bass just ruin the music. In 50% volume, it is somehow tolerable.. ◆ In Deep bass, music got muffled due to excessive bass. Bass quality is not up to the mark. Deep bass somewhat Ok with low volume. In high volume, it just terrible. Prefer to use normal mode.. ◆ Switch normal mode to deep bass mode was quite dificult. I struggled many time to switch between normal mode and deep bass mode. Too long press device got disconnected. Just press + and - simultaneously then lift.. ◆ Connectivity not good as infinity bt speaker.. ■ Overall, if you brand conscious, bassheaded and want a stylish, light weight, splash proof wireless headset under Rs 1.5K then it would be your cup of tea. I was very excited about it before using, but after using it continuously 2 hours I was disappointed. I expected, it would be produce balanced and descent sound like JBL C50HI, Realme buds 2 or Redmi basic earphone. But It disappoint me.. My rating for this device is: 2.8 out of 5",4.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 12 December 2020,Anand,Great battery backup and very good sound.,The first and foremost fbi g that I want to call out is that today (Saturday Dec 12 happens to be the 12th day of usage (average usage of 30-35 minutes per day in the gym listening to music only) and thr battery is still going strong. I have still not unwrapped the charger cable Or charged it. Simply started using it out of the box from day 1. In my books THAT is a huge plus for any brand.. Prior to this one I was using MIVI Beats for close to three years and it died a natural and logical death last month.. Other good things about this:. 1. Extremely light weight - I don’t feel like I am wearing them and no discomfort for upto 35 minutes of wearing. Honestly I have never used it any longer so I wouldn’t know.. 2. Snug fit. I am extremely picky about in ear headphones because 90% of them keep falling off my ears even with the slightest movement (including the mighty Apple headphones). I have oddly big years and I require silicon stubs to to hold the headphones in place. The ones in these headphones are both soft and sturdy. And the headphones NEVER fall off my ears during my workout.. 3. Sound quality is pretty much on par with other headphones and I will admit it is on the good side. I usually don’t play music at full volume so I don’t know if the sound cracks at high volume. Bass is quite good.. Some stuff that I personally don’t like.. 1. The overall design is not all that attractive. I feel the length of the wires could have been a little shorter.. 2. The control stub and its identical twin on the left side. While they look ugly I guess they house the power pack for the long battery life.. Overall I think this is great value for money. I have no hesitation recommending this.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 6 November 2020,Pavithran G,Get a load of this,Circuits made in one of our neighbours on this product arbitrarily jacks up the volume to max on connecting to an Apple iPad irrespective of last stored volume every single time. So once you connect to iPad you should do an extra step to reduce the volume immediately or risk blasting high volume noise into your ears. Every. Single. Time. I have attached a representative screen recording of this happening in real time.. What’s even more malicious is that the earphones mess with radio streams constantly by randomly pausing and playing the streams on iPad.. Both behaviours are unique to how this earphones behaves with an iPad and no such issues were noticed while connecting to android devices that I had.. Sound quality is average with hardly any highs or clarity and high bass but I guess that’s related to the price and nothing suspect on that count.. I don’t understand American companies still producing electronics in one of our neighbours with long soured relations. Overall very disappointing experience. Not to be used with an iPad.. 23rd day update: Totally dead. Seems inferior and compromised pieces are targeted at inconvenient individuals with precision.. 1.5 month update: after unsuccessfully arguing with JBL to deliver a replacement to my home they directed me to a service center where within minutes a replacement was issued hassle free with minimum computer work. Was pleased with process and customer service execs on phone were helpful as well. Replacement also messes with iPad internet radio streams and jacks up volume on connection! But quality of music on the earphones has grown on me since and I would classify it as above average. Big bass does compensate for other shortcomings. Worth noting JBL aka infinity aka Harman is a Samsung company.,3.0 out of 5 stars

And i know that no headset will match my AKG headset under this price range, so I placed the order.. My initial impression about the quality is great, listened to many songs and i really liked the sound quality, it has good bass , mid is not that great with default equalizer setting but I know how to tweak it, so I feel it's a great product for the price.

Coming from Apple Airpods 2, this was a pleasant surprise! Holy crap these sound amazing for the price I paid. Personally, I'm a basshead and OMG I literally cried out of joy for what my ears were listening to after a long while of using much balanced sounding Airpods! This little MF at 800 bucks gave me what I was serching for so long. The vocals, lows, mids, bass everything is a joy to listen. Especially the bass and lows. Brilliant. I switched from Airpods cz of the unintentional sensor activities while I would lie down or hit the gym, it's just irritating. So Indecided to go for something with tactile feedback inputs rather than touch controls. This neckband is probably the best ""my kinda music"" delivering pair of earphones I've ever came across lately. Battery backup is decent, my only gripe is a type-C input to juice it up. Gives me around 4 to 5 hours of straight on sessions at around 75% volume (honestly you don't wanna go anything above that on these, they are insane!) Obviously I miss out on the charging case convenience on-the-go but I carry my Airpods anyways for ""occasional"" outdoor use. For intense listening with great sound, THIS IS IT!.

So my expectations for sound quality was some what high but I'm disappointed. Bass is full and pronounced, mid are okay and highs are simply missing and muffled. Moreover I don't feel it's a polished product. Specs on paper are very good like bluetooth 5.0 and IPX rating but using product is a different experience. Bluetooth takes more than 3 seconds to connect everytime. It is impossible to turn on bass mode by holding volume up and volume down button, all it does is disconnect from the device. And if you don't hold power off button for 5 seconds and leave it in 4 or 4.5 seconds it will call the most recent dialled number.

Reviewed in India on 27 August 2020,Siddhpura Mitt,"TL;DR : Sound Quality=Great, Call Quality=Excellent, Price vs Value=decent, Durability=?","Along with the review, I would like to add some information (added at the end) as well that I feel is not properly available.. Price : INR 1299 and Initial Impressions Review. Review :. Sound Quality : Great but not Excellent. The biggest value with this earphone is that you can enjoy music of most spectrum with the ""normal mode"". With under INR 2000, as against Realme Buds and Boats rockers earphones, this was one of the best wireless earphones that had a ""normal bass mode"". I am not a bass head and if you too are not, kindly consider this option. I personally use Sennheiser CX 180 and JBL C100SI. If I compare, the sound quality is kind of similar to Sennheiser CX 180 and particularly the bass is more than what Sennheiser CX180 offers but less than that produced by JBL C100SI IN BASS MODE. Though I prefer flat headphone types, I do enjoy Jazz or heavy metal music as well as music with thump beats in ""deep bass"" mode in this earphones. At full volume, the earphones do not sound that great, but I guess that issue is with every budget segment earphones. Unlike what many have mentioned, I really did not find any delay between video and audio playback, whether it was online streaming on OTT apps or offline.. Call Quality : Excellent. I had the budget to buy earphones upto INR 2000 and One plus bullets Z at INR 1999 really felt like a good deal. The problem is that I found many reviews of One plus stating the problem that they had to bring the Mic up close. One of the reasons I chose this earphone is because I did not find any such reviews with Infinity Glide 120. In my experience as well, the call quality was excellent, for me and the listener on the other side, during normal calls as well as WhatsApp calls.. Range=Excellent. I have moto G5s Plus that has a aluminum uni-body and because it has a metal casing, I always have problem with network and connectivity. With this mobile, I could get a range of 15 feet (clear sight view). However, using this earphone with my laptop, I got atleast further 5 feet addition in range. With the marketed 10 meter range, I do not know how much that holds in practical scenario.. Durability = ?. It better be good. I really can't say on the durability and I hope it lasts long. I will update this review in case, I find any issues.. Price vs Value=Decent. One of the cons with these earphones is that unlike other manufacturers, it doesn't have the ability to pair with more than one devices and the same time. Moreover, with a different perspective, the sound quality produced by these earphones are comparable (and not better) than wired earphones (Sennheiser CX 180 and JBL C100SI) that are available at half the price. I understand that the sound quality cannot be compared of wired and wireless earphones but I really think that as a consumer paying twice the money, I should get better sound quality atleast by marginal improvement.. User Experience :. 1. One of the biggest pros of the product is that I did not have to worry if the mic is close enough to my mouth. The call quality on the other side was decent. I feel that the trigger time to play previous/next song while holding down the Volume +/- key is very long.. 2. Moreover, changing between 'normal mode' and 'deep bass' mode with pressing volume +/- key simultaneously is not one-handed operation even though I tried.. 3. Unlike other products available at a higher price, the magnets are not ""functional"" in the context of functioning as play/pause or on/off trigger.. Important Information :. 1. As attached in the spec sheet from the official website, the 7 hour music playback time is with 50% volume, something that should be known.. 2. As compared to here, you can also check the reviews on the other website of the competition in which Infinity Glide N120 is available. Both the models, Infinity Glide 120 and Infinity Glide N120 are same with the difference of hard plastic neckband in ""N120"" model. You may also check those reviews which has 6x times more ratings/review as compared to here. I believe this is because this product in not highlighted in first two pages in ""wireless earphones"" section.. Hope this review was helpful.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 9 September 2020,abi s.,Opinion after 1 week usage,"After 1 week of usage,. Here's my opinion ; (a detailed honest review). Its definitely worth for the price you pay.. Has average battery back-up.(nearly 8 hrs) and charges very fast(in 1 hour). The build quality is also great. Has a metal housing of earbuds which is better in terms of ruggedness and sound damping(if you are more into bass). The battery compartment & control compartment is dense plastic made.. The IPX5 sweat and water resistance is convincingly helpful whenever working out or listening to music in drizzle rain. BT version 5.0 is very neat and clean and gives a seamless connection, even through 2 concrete walls( I've tested 👍). Based on sound quality, it packs the Harman kardon signature sound. Also has two inbuilt EQ mode(normal and deep bass ). Honestly speaking, the deep bass mode increases the low frequency area (i.e, bass) but also decreases the high frequency and mid range frequency (i.e, vocals and melodic instruments). This mode is only ideal for EDM genre, hip-hop genre and rock genre.. The normal mode is most ideal for melodic songs, romantic songs, etc. This also benefits that you can switch over whenever required(because in other high bass, deep bass, ultra bass earphones, melodic songs will be crap). It DOESN'T have an active noise cancellation.. I mean, come on.. don't expect noise cancelling earphones in this price range. It isn't equipped with any noise cancellation technology, except the passive noise cancellation (which is only provided by the tight sealed rubber earbuds). And it has good microphone noise reduction while calling.. That's all. Now my opinions if you are trying to buy this earphones ;. This is the better earphones in this price range . Trust me cause I've researched a lot about earphones before buying.. And also you can see two versions of this earphones in amazon and flipkart which is- infinity glide 120(amazon) and infinity glide N120(flipkart). There is a slight difference in these 2. The one from the Flipkart is 100 rupees more costly and also has a hard rubber neckband.. The one from the Amazon is 100 rups cheap than from flipkart and doesn't have a neck-'BAND'. And the amazon product is better in my opinion bcs, it is more flexible and convenient in handling. If you are on a strict budget, try this one. If you can add a slight 700/- more .. Absolutely try the new boAt rockerz 355. Launched today, only the best earphones for 2000/- range.. Hope I'm helpful",4.0 out of 5 stars

So I had this bunch of options from Realme, Mi, Boult, BOAT and others... But I know what a perfectly tuned earphones sound like, from JBL, Sony, senheisser etc.. which are very much costly compared to the bugdet brands out there.. Then I got to know about Infinity, a sub brand from Harman which is focussed on less expensive audio devices. Because obviously they don't want to decrease the price of already existing sub brands like JBL.. So I order these Infinity Glide 120 @Rs. 899/- after going through a lot of positive reviews and sufficient specs at this price range.. Although, I didn't like the yellow patches here and there which provide a seal for water resistance, I bought these as I focused on sound and not looks.. It may be good design to others but I prefer the most plain and basic designs in everything.. The design is quite elegant though, it could have been even better (for me) if they provided another colour variat with black patches.. And coming to the most important part, the sound quality, be assured that you are getting a great balanced sound with clear vocals and Excellent balanced bass.. And yeah that DEEP BASS mode helps for people who love to pain their eardrums with thumping Bass. I'm not an extra bass lover but music sounds better with Deep bass mode On.. And for the comfort part, it's not so good for long hours of use. I used the smallest sized eartips but still I can't use it longer. It's definitely not the most comfortable pair of earphones out there.. Also, another variant of this one called GLIDE N120 (N is for neckband) is completely the same except the thicker and less flexible neck band.. I carry my earphones in my pocket or in a travel pouch and so neckband wasn't my choice. This model, Glide 120, is perfect to carry around..
