Battery backup is awsome (Note: 10mins charge for 10hrs works only if you are using the 30W warp charger). Low latency works only in fnatic mode (only in OnePlus device).

The packaging by OnePlus is superb, better than packing provided by JBL, SkullCandy, etc.. Coming to main review-. Pros:. Sound quality is better than any other wireless headphones in the price range.. Build quality is not premium but better than average.. The device switching function is great and hassle free.. Sound is optimally loud.. Battery life and charging time is awesomely fast.. Cons:. Sound lag while playing games and videos if HD Audio is turned on in Bluetooth Device's Setting. (around 500ms delay). Low latency is just a marketing strategy, you can never feel difference between sound delayswhile fnatic mode on and off.. If you are consider using this earphones for playing PUBG or COD an your primary internet is over WiFi, use these only if you have 5ghz band wifi, because bluetooth works over 2.4ghz band that will interfere with your wifi and give you high ping/latency. Also, you will need to turn the HD Audio off in Settings>Bluetooth & Device Connections > Bluetooth > OnePlus WirelessZ to get a least sound lag experience.. If they could have provided this earphone with NFC support as well, than this could be a great deal of budget earphones. Now, it is just another pair of bluetooth earphones. When HD Audio is turned on you can literally hear everything in the game, you can tell the opponent position more precisely just by hearing footsteps, but again there will be an audio lag that will be of great loss.",4.0 out of 5 stars

These pair of earphones is not ideal for listening to music. All these earphones are aimed at is for making you life a lil easier and a lot easier if you have a OnePlus device like me( OnePlus 7 pro in my case). Lemme tell you how. 1) Awesome battery life. I got it at full charge when I unboxed it it's the third day of my use haven't charged it yet and am still hovering around 30%. I'm pretty sure I used it over 5hrs the past two days and in and around 3 hrs now and it still had 30% charge left. So their claim of 20hrs is kinda true as I fell if I go hard on it today even then I'll get atleast 5hrs more of battery life that would make it in the territory of around 18-19 hrs. Good job OnePlus. 2)Easy pairing with a OnePlus device as it shows a headsup when you turn on bluetooth of your phone and wake the neckband up with the push of a button on the nack band. As for other devices you have to connect it the old fashioned way and once connected it would connect almost instantly the second time. Thubs up again. 3) Water, dust and sweat resistant. If you are like me you you swaet a lot don't wory cuz these can take those sweaty time no problem. 4)Very light weight to wear and you will no find it uncomfortable but after a few hours you would still find it a lil taxing on your ears like any earphones do but still it's better than most other I've tried. 4)If you have other devices like me then you will love the quick switch it's really handy. Now let me tell you who this earphones are not for. 1) If you wanna play mobile games on any other phone other than OnePlus DONT BUY THIS. CUZ IVE NOTICED SOME LAG IN THE IN GAME SOUNDS, EVEN IF IT'S NOT THAT HIGH THAT YOU CANT PLAY ITS STILL THERE AND YOU WILL NOTICE IT. PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YOU WILL GET USED TO IN TIME, YOU MAY BUT I DIDN'T. ALWAYS GO FOR A WIRED EARPHONES FOR THAT.. Well if you have OnePlus device it comes with this fnatic gaming mode so the latancy us remarkably low and very much playable. But that's an exclusive feature so yea.. 2)If you love listening to music and you need those rich base and lovely vocals and clear mids and highs never buy ANY BLUETOOTH EARPHONES IN THIS PRICE RANGE, ALL OF THEM SOUND GARBAGE COMPARED TO WIRED COUNTERPARTS WITH SAME PRICE. THIS DOESN'T MEAN THE OP BULLETS Z IS BAD BUT IT WAS UNDERWHELMING FOR ME AS I HAVE BEEN USING THE ""Sony MDR XB75AP"" for the past 2 years and I haven't yet found anything that sounds better than those in this price bracket for a long time.. SO IF YOU ARE LIKE ME WHO HAS A DECENT PAIR OF WIRED EARPHONES THAT GIVE YOU GREAT SOUND QUALITY BUT WANT THE CONVINCE OF A WIRELESS SOLUTION GO FOR IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. PS: THE SOUND OF THESE GOT BETTER OVER THE 3 DAYS IVE BEEN USING IT, I DON'T KNOW IF ME ADJUSTING TO IT OR IF IT IS THE BURN IN OF EARPHONE THAT OCCURRED IT SOUNDS MUCH BETTER NOW AND YOU WILL BE BETTER OF LISTENING TO MELODIES AND MUSIC WITH BASS JUST ENOUGH TO GIVE THE MUSIC A DEPTH TO THE SONG CUZ FOR THOSE THESE ARE GREAT AND VOCALS AND HIGHS ARE PRETTY WELL BALANCED. YOU DO GET ENOUGH BASE FOR THE SONG BUT NO OVERPOWERING IF YOU ARE INTO THAT THEN GO FOR IT .. BUT IF YOU WANNA SPEND THE MONEY TO GET AN EARPHONE THAT SOUNDS BETTER AND DON'T WANT THE FANCY WIRELESS LIFE THEN GO BUY ""SONY MDR XB-55AP, it's of the same price but way better quality of sound..

""If you don't have a wired earphone that sounds good then don't spend your money on any wireless earphones in this price bracket you will not be satisfied. Just buy ""Sony MDR-XB55AP @ ₹2000"".

Reviewed in India on 6 June 2020,Ankit,Magic Band!!,"I bought black variant from most trusted Amazon seller Appario Retail on 24th May.. Delivery was perfect and was done well before the promised delivery date even in this lockdown scenario.. Product was in new and original condition, and sealing was proper and untampered.. I use these with my OnePlus 7T android phone and Windows 10 Lenovo laptop.. I mainly use these for music listening, Netflix & Amazon Prime on my PC, Office meetings on Microsoft Teams platform, and college classes on Google Meet platform.. This is my first wireless neckband. Previously, I have used Sennheiser CX 275 S, Philips SHE1405WT and other wired earphones.. I love this product. I am perfectly happy with this product and haven't encountered any issues so far.. In detail -. Pros. 1. Perfect build quality and very functional, lightweight and comfortable design. 2. Neckband rests perfectly on my shoulder around my neck and doesn't fall off. Well balanced and comfortable. 3. Default earbuds fit perfectly in my ears, are comfortable and don't fall-off (big plus for me). 4. No issues in audio quality department. I have seen people complaining about this having not enough bass, but I haven't felt anything lacking in its sound. It's pretty satisfactory as per my taste. So, thumbs up for sound quality. Just to add, I haven't used any of the Sony's Xtra bass earphones so I cannot compare with them.. 5. Quick charging and long battery life. 6. Type-C charging so my OnePlus 7T charger is more than compatible with this neckband as well. No need to maintain or carry multiple cords or chargers. 7. Ease of connection is amazing. Just detach the earbuds and you are connected in less than a sec to your last connected device. Voila.. 8. Quick switching works flawlessly and is really quick too (within ~1 sec). I switch almost 20-30 times between my phone and laptop in a day and it works like a breeze every time. I am really impressed with such ease of switching. These buds have surpassed my expectations in this department. 9. Perfectly compatible with Windows 10, and Microsoft Teams and Google Meet platforms on laptop. Haven't had any issues taking my meetings or classes so far. It works flawlessly, no audio breaking, stuttering or dropped connections. Connection is robust and reliable. Audio quality is also loud, clear and good. This neckband is as good and trustworthy in this department as you would expect from any other good wired earphones. Any issues in this department would have been a real deal breaker for me. So I am kinda relieved and also impressed with its perfect performance. 10. Mic quality is good too. Haven't had any issues making myself hear using this neckband. No complaints from me or the person I am talking to so far. Cons. None so far. I don't play mobile games so no comments on lag or anything from my side.. I have been using it (heavily) only for one and a half weeks now, so no comments on its durability.. Overall, this is perfect product. Robust and perfect in every department. Flawless. No complaints so far. Great product from OnePlus. I really love my first neckband and I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a perfect product in every department. A big thumbs up to this product and OnePlus. Go for it without thinking twice.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Here i will say all pros and cons in my experience. So guys, i think if you read my full review it will help you before buying this OP Z.. Last month(August) i purchased this OP Z through amazon. After using one month i write this review.. 1.Unboxing:. 1st of all hats off to amazon for delivering this product within 2 days. Included 1 red C type cable, extra two pair of earplugs and manual. I received this new OP Z with Fully charged (100% charged). 2. Experience:. I lik this OP Z very much. It is very weightless and easily carried out wherever u go.. Battery backup is amazing, it lasts up to 19hours and worth for continuous users. I think(but not sure) bluetooth range is 20feet.. It comes with a magnetic attach, there is no on/off button if we separate that magnetic earpiece then earphone will be automatically ON and pair instantly within 3seconds and also this magnet have other features like play/pause songs (If magnet is attach song will be paused, and if separate it will not play in other mobiles but,friends told it works in oneplus mobiles ), attend/end the calls.. It has volume up/down and song play/pause, call attend/reject button (center button) separately. When we increase/decrease the volume through earphones it doesn't work on our mobile(it works on oneplus mobile). Extra button is used for pairing two devices alternately it will help to pairing two devices.. When this earphone is ON White light is blinking. While charging Red light is glowing and white light is glowing when fully charged.. Mic is so cool and works perfectly. Audio quality is amazing and very clear.. Bass is not much good but not bad it is average so only i give 3 stars for this bass. But background music is crystal clear. But if we adjust bass in mobile it is better.. 3. Finally:. Overall best product in this 2k range comparing to other products, becuase it is value for money and reliable too.. Really i am a bass lover but i am satisfied with this product because of having many advantages in this OP Z and also one main reason is according to bluetooth devices, the bass feels little bit low comparing to wired earphones. I like black,blue and oat colour. But i bought OAT COLOUR bcoz, i had Vivo V17 white colour mobile(here i attached photos). Yesterday again i bought one OP Z black colour. Next week I will buy TWO MORE pair of earphones for my family members.. Note: Here, i attach black , oat and blue colour earphones stills. Guys, i spend more time for writing this review.

Excellent battery life of 20hrs claimed however even with heavy use these run for 2 days without a charge. Also the magnetic stick together ear plugs are quite useful in conserving phone as well as the head set battery life. The battery of the oneplus bullets wireless 1 lasted well for over 3yrs with heavy usage..

And coming to the sound quality, yes it's not the best in class when it comes to bass, also it will not disappoint you. These earphones are really loud and fits perfectly in my ear. Thanks to those extra buds. They don't mention anything about noise cancelation but it's the loudness and the way it fits that will make you believe that it has inbuilt noise cancelation. It also has low latency mood for gaming and all but it only works with one plus devices that too in fnatic mood only. That's the only thing that I didn't like. And yes about connectivity, it is very easy to connect. It doesn't have a on/off button and hence all these are happening though that magnetic locking. Once you detached them, with in seconds, it will get connected and if you attached them together then it just shut down. The connectivity range is also pretty decent,in fact more than sufficient.

Reviewed in India on 14 July 2020,ManiE,Best Budget Wireless Earphones,"OnePlus definitely stands out in innovating its products and the Bullet Wireless Z is no less exception, one cannot probably get anything better in this budget.. The sound quality is GOOD if not awesome (one cannot complain comparing them much expensive earphones), the bass, treble are well balanced and the earphone design perfectly suits at least in my ears. I have used them continuously for over 4 hours and didn't felt any pain or much discomfort, only issues I faced is the cold felt as the earphones are made of some metal.. The rubbery back is much better than many wireless earphones which just provide a wire, these are flexible still holds well on the neck, even one can use them lying on the bed and they will still grip well on the neck with no pressure compared to plastic ones, the wire ones on the other hand tends to slip.. The best part about these wireless earphones is its battery, it just last longer and charges up very fast even with normal chargers, there is no need to use the OnePlus Warp charger and the company recommends a normal 2A charger which will charge it fully in around 40-45 mins and lasts around 20 hours of usage.. The small USB to type C cable provided can also be used for data transfer, the size is good to carry around and use in both phone and the earphones.. Lastly it syncs really well with OnePlus phones, connects to Bluetooth really fast and supports Dolby Atmos, one can enable it in Settings > Sound & Vibration > Dolby Atmos and experience a better music and game playback,. Magnets on the earphones are really powerful and provides the on/off feature which is really very handy",5.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 16 November 2020,Noble P Mathew,"Not Bad at all.Better distance than Jabra,Anker.","For 2000r I wasn't expecting much from these.I recently bought the 8T which I'm still reviewing but one of its shortcomings is the BT connection. I have Jabra Elite Actives 65t and Anker Curves. Both of these give me great coverage on the PocoF1 and Galaxy Note9. But for some reason the 8T only gives half coverage. So I figured let me try a set of their own ear buds. And there is an improvement in the distance covered. Also I only gave 4 stars because compared to the Bass (Thump thump) of my Anker Soundcore Curves,these are a bit lacking. And for all the hype that surrounds the Jabra 65t well their not as thumpy as the ankers. But the OnePlus buds have a couple of features that help it to stand out.. 1 magnetic pause. 2 loud volume. 3 neckband is soft and can't lose it when you take. One of them out.. 4 coupled with the on board DAC of the 865 SOC these sound better than the price of 2000r.. 5 Type C charging reduces cable clutter..

This is totally an average product. Sounds ok. Bass is normal but still overpowers vocals and instruments and the overall sound becomes muddy.. NOBODY mentioned this even once! You can't record your voice using its mic in recorder apps. It's like the earphones are set as headphones instead of headset by default. Don't rely on oneplus to fix this via any update coz they would've fixed it by now if they wanted to.. Battery life is GREAT and the switch button is super useful for those with multiple devices!. It can handle sweat but can't say about long term.. Latency is not low or anything. It's normal and same as other earphones in this price range. Fnatic mode does not improve the latency enough to actually make any difference.. No aptx hd or ldac. Only aac so keep that in mind.. Verdict : Don't buy this if sound is your primary concern and you make voice notes or send voice messgaes on apps like whatsapp. It's bad. Really bad.. The only good things about these is the battery life, fast charging and switch button. Other than that, it's just an average product.. For under 2k, get the oppo enco 31 instead.

Reviewed in India on 12 August 2020,Parikshit Dev,Charge it and keep using it for days,"The one-plus Bullets wireless Z is my fifth try in Bluetooth earphones. All the previous ones failed due to bad sound or low battery backup. These headphones are just bliss in both categories. I used to love bass heavy earphones but over time, I've started realizing the importance of balance in the sound and the stage created by any earphones. If you are looking for bass-heavy earplugs, use a size bigger silicon tip to create extra seal in your ears, that would allow you to enjoy the bass in any earphones. But no sealing can provide the right balance and sound-stage in headphones until 2700rs.. I wanted to try the Oppo enco M31, as it costed the same as these pair. but the fragility of that device brought me closer to Bullets Z. Although Amazon offers a 10 day replacement policy, I never thought of returning this pair.. When these arrived, they had some charge still in them. So used it till it disconnected and then charged for exactly 10 minutes. Voila, they lasted me close to 2 days. Thereafter, a full charge, took me north of 1 hour which is not too long, as it gave me ample amount of time to completely change my phone too. Once charged, i was using sporadically for about 4-5 hours each day, and it lasted me 4 days. This setup has been ongoing since Jun'20.

On dropping the bus down, they hardly ever get magnetically closed.. - No carrying pouch. The money that's wasted in the packaging which I'll never use again might have better utilised in provinding a proper pouch for the clumsy earphone. - HD quality codecs like APTx etc are simply not available for this piece....

Reviewed in India on 19 February 2021,prasanth,Waste of money,"I am writing this review after using this for around two months now and i can only say that the experience was beyond frustrating.. Pros - The only great thing about this is the battery life. Was able to use it without charging for 2 days with around 7-8 hrs of music listening per day.. Cons:. 1.Sound quality is only is decent with little to no bass.. 2. Regular disconnecting issue - When taking a call, whether it be a regular call/whatsapp call/zoom call, after about 10 sec, it disconnects itself and after around 30 sec, it reconnects again. This cycle repeats itself because of which it is impossible to attend a call with this. Therefore, every time i need to take a call, i have to disconnect this from my phone or pc and use my wired headphones for that.. 3.Even if it does stay connected which happens very very rarely, it has zero noise cancellation - it picks every noise surrounding you and hence, the person is unable to hear what you are saying.. 3. I mainly bought this because of the quick switch feature since i can switch between my phone and laptop without manually going to settings to connect. Rather than making life easier, it has only made it difficult. Trying to save 5 sec resulted in spending hours trying to reset and reconnect this and going through online forms trying to find a solution to this. Turns out several people have the same problems and one plus hasn't responded to any of this. There is no firmware update, no workarounds, nothing.. Wasted 2k for this junk. Don't by it, especially if you are fascinated by the quick switch feature like i was. Its just for show.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 26 January 2021,Tirupati,Marvelous Earphone,🚦Writing this review after 6 months of usages.. I would only give pros and cons of it.. Pros-. #Excellent sound quality for music(I am not an audiophile). #Medium bass is there.. #Solid built quality (survived many drops). #No fuss usages make it a great earphone. #Dual connectivity is boon(double click to switch). #blutooth range is around 10 meter(with good coverage). #Magnetic auto pause feature is awesome. #Charging lasts easily a week for me with daily 5/6 hrs of usages(marquee feature). Cons-. #Noise cancellation is not excellent (works well in a room/flat with running fan).. #Not suitable for outdoor noisy env(market/traffic etc) create lot of problems for listeners though they can listen you well but the background noise irritates them.. Apart from this did not find any other issues with this earphone. Moreover one should not expect great noise cancellation with a 2k earphone.. ✅Verdict-. Definitely a must buy product. With the new bass model it fulfills the need of audio junkies as well😀,4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 11 August 2020,Aashutosh Chaubey,All Details that u need,"Design. As mentioned before, both the Bullets Wireless Z and the Enco M31 have the same essential form-factor. Both feature a magnetic clasp that holds the two speakers together when hanging by your neck and also switches them off. The Oppo are the lighter of the two by 6g, which is noticeable.. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z vs Oppo Enco M31. The Bullets Wireless Z have a more substantial design. Everything about them feels chunkier, with thicker stalks, stiffer cables, and larger speaker units. The Enco M31 have a more dainty feel, in comparison, with thinner, hollower feeling stalks and reedier cables. The speaker units are tiny compared to the Bullets Wireless Z.. The result of this is that the Bullets Wireless Z feel more premium of the two. While the Enco M31 are far from feeling cheap or poorly-built, they don't feel as polished and well-put-together as the Bullets Wireless Z. Much of the Bullets Wireless Z body comes from the more expensive Bullets Wireless 2 so they have a lot of the premium fit and finish that you'd expect from a more expensive pair of headphones.. Both pairs of earphones claim ingress protection for water. While OnePlus offers an IP55 rating, Oppo has an IPX5 rating, which is on par as far as water is concerned.. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z vs Oppo Enco M31. One of the things I wasn't a fan of on the Enco M31 is the placement of the controls. The controls are placed on the inside of the left stalk, rather than on the cable like on the Bullets Wireless Z. This makes them awkward to access and also makes it difficult to tell the left side from the right at a glance while putting them on. The controls on the Bullets Wireless Z are just better overall.. The only annoyance on the Bullets Wireless Z is that the LED on the side is too bright. If you enjoy listening in the dark, the flashing LED makes you feel like an aircraft flying through the night with its strobe lights flashing on the wings. It's bright enough to bother you and anyone sleeping next to you. The Enco M31 has a much more subtle LED that isn't even on outside of pairing and charging modes.. Comfort. Both the Bullets Wireless Z and the Enco M31 are comfortable pairs of earphones. The M31 are lighter but the Bullets Wireless Z don't feel heavy, either.. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z vs Oppo Enco M31. The Bullets Wireless Z have better quality ear tips. They have a plush feel to them and create a fantastic seal. The Enco M31 tips feel more ordinary in comparison but are comfortable nonetheless and also seal well.. Software and Features. Neither of these earphones have a custom app. However, they both offer some additional functionality when paired with their respective brand of smartphones.. OnePlus custom settings. OnePlus custom settings. The Bullets Wireless Z, for example, will show a pop up on a nearby OnePlus smartphone when in pairing mode. OnePlus also has a dedicated audio preset custom-designed for these earphones. The Enco M31 will also show the pairing pop up on select Oppo phones. This makes pairing easy as long as you have the supported phone, as neither of these have NFC.. Another thing they don't have is multi-device pairing. While both support Bluetooth 5.0, they can be paired to only one device at a time. Both have a mechanism to quickly switch between the current and last paired device. On the Bullets Wireless Z, you double click the pairing button. On the Enco M31, you press and hold the volume +/- buttons for three seconds.. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z vs Oppo Enco M31. The Bullets Wireless Z also offer a low-latency mode, which claims to reduce latency down to 110ms. This mode only works with select OnePlus phones with the Fnatic Mode enabled.. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z vs Oppo Enco M31. Both employ 9.2mm drivers with the Oppo having a titanium-plated composite diaphragm. The Bullets Wireless Z support SBC and AAC codecs while the Enco M31 also adds LDAC on top of that list. The Enco M31 also has a Hi-Res Audio Wireless certification.. The Enco M31 also include a Bass Mode, which can be activated by double-pressing the multi-function button. This amplifies the low-frequency response for a more bass-heavy sound. The mode cannot be engaged permanently and resets back to Balanced Mode when you switch off the headset.. Performance. The Oppo Enco M31 are the better sounding pair of earphones out of the two. They have a balanced, detailed sound with tight, punchy bass response, clean, distinct mid-range, and sparkling highs. The lack of emphasis or suppression of any particular region of the frequency response means the Enco M31 work well across all genres of music and even other types of content such as movies, podcasts, and games.. Once you get used to this type of sound signature, it's difficult to go back to the more pedestrian, bass or treble-heavy sound of other budget earphones. Your earphones are no longer influencing the sound of your content so you can hear it as it was meant to be heard without any coloration.. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z vs Oppo Enco M31. Some people might be tempted to claim this as a victory for the LDAC codec but the Enco M31 sound great regardless of what codec you use. Even when paired with an iPhone, the M31 still sound great, which is a testament to how the audio is tuned rather than any particular codec.. The Bullets Wireless Z clearly play second fiddle as far as the audio quality is concerned. Having said that, they don't sound bad, either. The Bullets Wireless Z have a more bass and treble-heavy sound, which is tuned more for mainstream tastes than accuracy. This is remedied a bit by the custom EQ profile on OnePlus phones, which brings down the low and high end to be more in line with the mids and also widens the soundstage a bit for a more natural sound. But you don't get this EQ on non-OnePlus phones.. Oddly enough, the choice of codec being used on the Bullets Wireless Z does play a role in how it sounds, and its even mode odd when you realize that they sound better with SBC than the default AAC codec. Switching back and forth between AAC and SBC from the Android Bluetooth menu, the SBC option sounded more mid-forward and also louder overall. This is obviously down to how the audio processor on the Bullets Wireless Z processes the two codecs but normally you shouldn't be hearing any difference in the sound signature between the different codecs, which is exactly what's happening here. If you have a non-OnePlus Android phone, I'd recommend disabling the AAC codec from the Bluetooth menu.. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z vs Oppo Enco M31. Overall, though, this is an easy victory for the Enco M31 because they have the most accurate sound. Not everyone wants accurate sound but that's not how you test audio gear. All audio tuning should be done on the device, not the speakers, which should be as neutral as possible. Having your speakers decide how your audio sounds is like painting your camera lens to get a color filter.. Audio quality aside, the Bullets Wireless Z do pull ahead of the Enco M31 in other aspects. Both have similar latency and the Fnatic Mode on the Bullets Wireless Z didn't seem to make much of a difference at all. But it's the microphone performance where the Enco M31 fall flat, with a pretty cheap and sorry excuse for a mic being used that often fails to get your voice across to your callers. The Bullets Wireless Z don't exactly have a professional podcast setup going on but sound better overall with clearer audio transmission during voice calls.. Battery Life. If you compare the on-paper numbers for battery life, you know the Bullets Wireless Z are going to win this round hands-down. OnePlus claims 20-hours of use on a full charge, with a 10-minute charge giving 10-hours of usage. That's pretty impressive for a neckband-style of earphones, particularly the second figure for a 10-minute charge, which is probably industry-leading.. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z vs Oppo Enco M31. Oppo, meanwhile, claims 12 hours with SBC and 8 hours with LDAC. Also, a 10-minute charge will only provide 3-hours of playback for LDAC.. If you read the individual reviews, you already know the numbers. The Bullets Wireless Z ran for the full 20-hours on a full charge and an impressive 13-hours on a 10-minute charge.. Meanwhile, M31 lasted for 7.5-hours with LDAC on a full charge and 11-hours with AAC (I didn't test SBC).. The numbers paint the entire story here. The Bullets Wireless Z are just better in terms of battery life. As someone who has used both, I cannot express how frustrated I am with the Enco M31 battery. To be fair, I use them more often — daily even — because of how good they sound. But that means I am also charging them one day apart while the Bullets Wireless Z would go for 4-5 days easily.. Both charge completely in just under an hour, so that's not an issue, but it's still frustrating to pause what you were listening to or watching because your speakers ran out of electricity. Of course, neither work while charging.. Conclusion. First of all, I would like to mention that it is crazy how affordable both these pairs of earphones are for the kind of performance they offer. While other companies are still robbing customers blind for the convenience of not having to plug their headphones in, OnePlus and Oppo have managed to come up with quality products that don't break the bank.. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z vs Oppo Enco M31. However, some concessions had to be made to achieve this price point, and nowhere is this more evident than on the Oppo Enco M31. While a truly stunning sounding pair of earphones, the M31 are dragged down by disappointing battery life and a low-quality microphone. The battery life, in particular, is disheartening because of how inviting they sound, which makes you want to listen to them more often, only to be told repeatedly that the battery is empty.. The Bullets Wireless Z has no such issue. While not exactly powered perpetually by a secret nuclear reactor, the roughly 3x battery life they enjoy over the Enco M31 means they may as well be. It gives you the confidence of wearing them over long journeys (as and when those become an option again) because you know a single charge will get you across the world. And the 10+ hour usage on a 10-minute charge is just icing on the cake.. OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z vs Oppo Enco M31. Moreover, the Bullets Wireless Z are also just better made. They look and feel more premium, have more sensible controls, and don't have a mic that makes you sound like you're calling from an underwater cave. The audio quality is not as technically impressive as on the Oppo, but most buyers in this price range may actually prefer the bass-heavy sound of the Bullets Wireless Z.. So for most people, the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z are just the more sensible choice. But if you're the sort of person who values audio quality over everything else, the Oppo Enco M31 won't disappoint.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It is at a very affordable price. At this price point I think it's really doing its job. I reduced one star as it can be a little more affordable due to lack of a lot of features.

Then this is a good choice.. Durability. 3.5/5. I think they are quite durable for normal usage. But for heavy usage, they tend to lack a bit.

Reviewed in India on 30 August 2020,Gautam,Go for it.,"Phenomenal product yet again by OnePlus. I had been using Boat Rockerzz for past one year. So I will put forward a basic comparison with that. Also I am a normal user. By that I mean, that I am not into much gaming, see videos on youtube, prime etc, listen to music. However I am not extremely cautious of bass, pitch, intensity, noise, and other technicalities. From a non technical-user perspective, whatever(problem/benefit) is not visible to me, I am not writing it.. 1. Bluetooth range is better than boat rockerzz. No problems anywhere 7-10m. Easy when you roam around in house. However, when battery is 30%, I noticed inconsistent sound at same range. Overall. I would say its better than rest.. 2. The switch on-off system of earphone is linked to magnets. When magnets are together, the earphone is automatically switched off. Takes off the effort of switching it on-off everytime.. 3. Connects to phone within 1-2 seconds. This is smooth and flawless, coupled with point 2. However, I have only tried it with my OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 7. Also, it is not as flawless in switching between phones. I had to disconnect/turn off bluetooth of one phone to connect it with another.. 4. Charges really really fast. 10 min 10 hours. 1 hour full charge, as it says. Also battery lasts for 3 days with normal calls. This period doesn't take into account music or movie.

Reviewed in India on 23 January 2021,Raj,Quick Switch and Quick Charge - These are Amazing Features,"I was confused between Oneplus Z, Oneplus Z Bass Edition and Oppo Enco M31. I am a regular use of Laptop (work from home) and mobile at same time. So i was looking for a earphone which can connect two devices at same time. Yes there are many earphone in market which connect two devices at a time. But to switch the connection between one (mobile) device to other (laptop) you have to manually open bluetooth devices and click on connect which is annoying as in Oneplus Z Bass Edition. Hence i decided to go with Oneplus Z. It's quick switch feature is very useful for me. Just double tap button in earphone, its connection will switch from mobile to laptop instantly within 2 seconds. Though Oppo Enco M31 have quick switch feature, it doesn't compare with battery life of Oneplus Z and quick charge. Oneplus Z just 10 mins of charge will give you 10 hours of battery life thats amazing.. Now coming to Sound Quality - As i had seen in reviews many had said it does not have good Bass. But when i tested myself it has adequate amount of Bass. It has very balanced Bass where you can listen other instruments sounds as well in the song. There are few people who likes only Bass and vocals (just they enjoy Boom Boom sound and vocals) If you want to enjoy the song you should listen all the instruments in the song, so i enjoyed listening to the music in Oneplus Z which has adequate amount of bass which never overpowers other instruments. If you still need more Bass than this then you can increase the Bass sound in equalizer as much as you want and enjoy only Boom Boom Sound and vocals.. Now Coming to Mic sound quality - Earlier i was using Realme Buds Wireless (first gen). When i was talking in phone while driving meany people never able to listen what i am talking, they were hearing only wind sound. So I could not use Realme buds wireless when i was driving. It was giving lot of wind noise to other end users when i was driving. But i did not face such issues in Oneplus Z, other person is able to hear clearly what i am talking (of course there was wind noise as well but not as high as Realme). Verdict - Oneplus Z quick switch feature and quick charge feature and 20 hours of battery life is Amazing. Even listening to song in this is Amazing. Just go for it without second thought. Instead of buying Oneplus Z Bass edition just for Bass purpose, buy Oneplus Z which has nice features as i have mentioned. Of course Bass you can increase in equalizer ( i am using poweramp in mobile to listen to song which as custom equalizer). Thanks Oneplus Z for giving nice features at affordable price.. Regards.

Battery life is the main thing about it. With one charge, it can stay up to 1 and half day. If you have a fast charger, it charges within 1hr (am having a 18W fast charger of Samsung S9), if you have a faster charger it will charge more quickly like the 30W which you get with the Oneplus devices. You can use it for gaming also, but sometimes there is a lag in the sound like it takes a half a second to detect that sound. Also, I liked the way it can be turned on or off by the magnetic pull. Another thing is you can easily switch between devices by clicking the button twice (black button seen on the earphone), and that one works most of the time. You don't have disconnect from one device and then connect to another device, all you need to do is turn on the other device bluetooth and press the button twice present on the earphones.

Build quality:- Great!!!, considering this price point, Oneplus has provided the best build quality in this earphone, better than the Realme wireless.. Bluetooth connectivity:- Best, It connects instantly with the last connected device as soon as you detach those buds from each other which are connected through the magnet. Realme earphone also gets connected but the feature which is missing in Realme is Bluetooth switch, which you will miss a lot because sometimes I get annoyed, when Realme earphone connects with any device, and then I have to tell that person to switch off their Bluetooth.. Sound Quality and treble:- Best!!!, Crisp and clear sound, you can hear every word clearly, better than Realme in terms of sound quality. Bass:- A big no!!!, if you are a bass lover and love to hear 3d sound music or music with high base, then these earphones are surely not for you. Bass is pretty low, please don't take me wrong and think that I hate Oneplus, because I have seen a lot of earphones with better bass in this price range. Also, Realme earphone has better bass than these ones.. So, Overall package is good, 4/5 rating, but if you are bass lover don't go for these ones.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Dual pairing mode is heaven and quick connectivity feature is just like God mode. For me i use phone and laptop alternatively. So with just a double press and in 2 seconds it switches between the devices.. 5. Great Bluetooth range.. 6. Sound quality is average. Like the highs and lows are ok'ish. 7.best of all is the battery 10 mins charge for 10 hrs and 25 mins for 20hrs😍. Its like having a neckband connected to the wall socket forever.. 8. Weight and comfortability is great. Literally you wouldnt even feel you have something on ur next and in your ears🤣🤣. Its that sick.. 9. It comes with 1 year warrenty so no worries for anything whatsoever.. 10. OnePlus unboxing experience. Its something exquisite. Cant describe in words.. Cons. 1. It doesnt have any sort of active noise cancellation. Trust me... The person on the other side could hear your background noise even more clearer than your voice😂.. 2. Sometimes the Bluetooth disconnects and reconnects and at times the dual pairing feature doesnt work as expected. It irritates me at such times and finally i either try to turn the headset off and on or if this doesnt work.. I proceed with a reset and then pair again.. 3. When using the neck band paired to the laptop, the volume buttons do not control the system volume instead control the headphone volumes. I think its due to the incorrect driver config. But the volume buttons work great with android.. Overall, if you are in a calm enough room then you wouldnt face any issues with the backgroud noise and the noise cancellation issue would be sorted.. Since the neckband comes with an inline microphone, you could use your hand to pull tye microphone near to your mouth so as to clearly speak to the listener.. If you are a person who is not sooo sensitive to the greatest highs and lows of music and you do some ordinary listening and voice calling. This headset is for you. You cant expect 5000 rupee product in a 2000 rupee budget. So comparing with battery life, product quality, music quality, and features, it is indeed a recommended product.

Pros : fast battery charge, even if it was discharged and you need it urgently then just charge it for 2mins and you are good to use it for next 2 hours.. Sound : i didnt even turn it to max sound ! Its so loud. But the audio is crystal clear and there is no quality loss. Ya it do not have aptx support but that dosent make any diffrence if you have upgraded from a low budget 1000rupee earpeice to this one . but people with good earphone like bose or apple airbuds will definitely notice a magrinal diffrence.. Easy switch between laptop and phone calls: this is the best feature guys and i works as a video editor and wearing those over the ear headphones can be so sweety and hot sometime . so now i just connect these via bluetooth to my computer to work on my projects . and if i have a phone call to take i can just double tap and it connects to the phone in a second . so if you have a laptop then this can come really handy as you need to carry just one pair of earphones to work or anywhere .. Mic : i believe mic is good sometime people have complaint that they cant here me please speek louder . so i need to hold my mic to face sometimes. Cons : well the material used is not that good and it becomes quiet painfull to wear them at long periods like 8+hours straight . i do alot of editing work so yeh i need to pull them off . its design is quiet curvy to the ears so that could be the root cause.. Connectivity : i have faced a little range and conectivity issues sometime when i goo far from it like if there are 2 walls between my earphone and my phone the there is a little jitter and you need to come back to the range to get signals.

If you have a OnePlus phone, you must go to audio and the sound enhancement should be set to ""General Enhancement"" and not ""Bullets Wireless"". The former provides a richer sound while the latter gives a ""hollow"" sound (Try them on both settings, trust me it would be pretty hollow). And if you feel the bass is inadequate, trust me it is not, you have just not worn them properly. Insert them deep and snug into your ears rather than letting them linger on the outskirts. You can confirm the presence of pretty heavy bass if you slightly push them into your ears.. TL/DR-. 1. OnePlus users run them in General Enhancement mode in sound settings.. 2.

Unpair it simply to turn on. - can connect within fraction of seconds when bluetooth is already enabled in Phone.. - Turned on at 9.45am today morning and used till now continuously and reduced 40% of charge for 12+ hours usage and 60% remaining.. - Sound is awesome especially when u have a dynamic setting in Dolby Atmos. - coming to the bass, I saw many reviews stating bass is bad, but it's absolutely wrong. Bass is great without any issues. If you want an extra thump, change the intelligent style to Nuanced mode in sound setting and enable 'Adapt to OnePlus bullets Z wireless' else you can tune the equaliser to more thump. But normal one will be fine.. - I also saw reviews that there is latency in pubg game. I played pubg for an hour and didn't find any latency and it's smooth too...

Reviewed in India on 17 July 2020,Arup Sutradhar,ONE DECENT PIECE OF AN EARPHONE.,"This would be a review from a commoner like myself, who only understands the benefits he gets for what he paid for.. (Before proceeding, I'd like to mention that I'm using OnePlus 7T to pair with the OnePlus Bullet Z Wireless earphone, due to which the points mentioned below might be possible). The main attractive point of this earphone is it's experience. By experience I mean:. a). EASE OF USE.(which is exceptional! i would say. Just by connecting the two earpieces you can turn it off and turn it on by separating them). Everytime I recieve a call, I would just unplug the two earbuds and it would get connected to my phone and I can receive the call hence, through the earphone. I mean, can it get any easier than this?. b). BATTERY LIFE: For a user like me who listens to music for one hour approx everyday and receive calls the way I mentioned above, THE BATTERY LASTS ALMOST/MORE THAN A WEEK FOR ME!!!. c). CHARGING TIME: With the C-type cable provided with the earphones, and the Warp Charger of my phone it gets charged to 100% by 20 minutes.. d). Sound Quality: After I read the reviews on Amazon about users pointing out about the bass, I was confused whether or not to go ahead with this product. But after using it for more than a month, I would say it has the best balance of the sound levels. The mids are good, so is the bass! Trust me, any level of bass higher than will only result in a headache! Super impressed with the sound quality.. e). CONNECTIVITY: It takes less than 2 secs for the earphones to get connected to my device. Moreover when I'm using my laptop and want to switch the earphone connection from my phone to the laptop, I'd simply double tap and the connection will get switched without any hussle! How awesome is that!. The above mentioned points should summarise the the kind of experience I was talking about earlier.. I hope my review helps you while buying this amazing product :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 12 December 2020,Kaustubh,"A decent VFM purchase, ticks most of the boxes.","In terms of VFM proposition, it's hard to beat the bullets wireless Z. The decision on opting these as your go-to earphones can primarily hinge on three points:. 1. Excellent battery life - should easily last for the whole day (even 2) for the most demanding of stints.. 2. Usability - magnetic control, quick switch. 3. Decent sound quality: For their price, the bullets deliver great sound quality for majority of the genre spectrum. But the lack of range and sharpness is quite evident when you bring in classic rock or grunge music into the frame, especially when comparing these to my previous daily driver, Sennheiser CX 275s.. All in all, at this price, the bullets should serve you well. Audiophiles however, should look elsewhere for better performance..

Now talking about the Bullets Wireless Z, I can say it's true OnePlus product, OBWZ (OnePlus Bullet Wireless Z) looks so good, although this time it's all plastic around earbuds unlike metal which we had in OBW 1 and 2, but that makes it lightweight and the price ofcourse.. You can connect them to two sources at a time and can easily switch between them just by pressing the button twice and I was so surprised that it take only 1 or 1.5 seconds in doing so. That is so fantastic for me, as I can listen to music on laptop while working and can switch to my OnePlus 5t for calls.. Sound quality is superb, you'll start to feel all the instruments being played and plus they gets real loud. I received the OBWZ at 80% charged out of the box, and almost used it for 3 hours and they are still at 80%. I've not tested it for battery life yet, but I guess they will do good.. Now coming to the main point where I feel it's lacking a bit is the bass, there is bass but if you are basshead like me and have used sony's XB series than you'll surely feel the difference. But for regular users these will sound just awesome.. So final verdict, affordable, nicely build, IP55 water and sweat resistance, long battery, sounds so good.. Go for it you won't regret.

Reviewed in India on 12 February 2021,Vishnu Rajeev,"Definitely worth the money, but not the best","This review might be long, but it's honest. These are one of the best in ear wireless earphones for the price, out in the market right now. I purchased this for my brother, and later, I got the same earphones for my birthday. I also use a Sony WI-C400 (priced around Rs.3500) and Apple Airpods Pro, and I will be comparing the bullets wireless Z bass edition with these two.. Pros:. 1) This one charges very quickly, especially if you have a OnePlus Warp charger adapter. I use a OnePlus 8 and these earphones charges to a 100% in around 40 mins. The Sony on the other hand takes around 3 hours to get to full charge.. 2) It pairs instantly. As soon as you separate both the earpieces, it pairs with the phone in under 4 seconds. It is similar to what happens with an iPhone and Airpods/Airpods Pro. To pause the music or video, you just have to clip them both together, which also turns off the earphones, thus saving battery.. 3) Very lightweight and comfortable. The earphones weigh just 28 grams, and while wearing them, I don't actually feel it. It also looks good when one wears it. The Sony earphones were heavy and sometimes uncomfortable.. 4) The sound quality is very good. It is actually better than the Sony in terms of clarity and loudness. I rarely have to raise the volume to 50%. The bass is decent; I wouldn't say it's great, even with the bass edition. But considering the price, the bass is pretty good.. 5) IP55 water resistance means that I can use these earphones while working out or when I go out cycling.. Cons:-. 1) It has a noticeable amount of latency. Even though OnePlus advertises low latency of 100ms, you can actually feel the latency while watching videos or listening to music. The Sony WI-C400 is way better in terms of latency; it's almost non existent.. 2) While playing games and listening to music at the same time, the music seems to break every now and then. This did not happen with the Sony WI-C400, and this irritates me every time.. Final verdict: If your budget is around 2000-2500, then don't look for anything more, buy the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition. If you are willing to spend more, then I would suggest you go for Sony. I have been a long time Sony user, and all Sony earphones I have used has lasted at least 3 years for me. Sony earphones are made in Vietnam, while OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition is made in China. For me, only time will tell how durable this earphone is, but I'll surely be updating this review is anything goes wrong.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Adequate bass (youtube and inbuilt mi music player), superb bass with any equaliser (i used spotify). 2. connection is seamless.. but sometimes gets disconnected automatically ,, but very rare,, all i do all day is connect and disconnect so may be thats why it happens (once in 50 times ). 3. magnetic on off works perfect. 4.

The other person hears a lot of background noise and if you're in traffic, person on the other end will not be able to hear you due to high noise from the surroundings.

Reviewed in India on 13 June 2020,GSB,Fantastic value for money!,"This is a 3 day usage review. My old bluetooth headset was giving me problems and so I was looking for a new one. I use a op5 and so was keen to evaluate the newly released bullets wireless z and so ordered it.. Summary: I think it's totally worth it. As I wfh, I was looking for a hands-free headset which I could use with phone n pc(teams). The battery life is great but the connect function is just awesome. I have tried connecting it to my laptop and my TV. It connects quickly to the new device n the mic quality is quite good. In my opinion, these (long battery life and connect feature) features are the best. While connected to the TV, I didn't feel that there was a lag.. As far as sound quality is concerned, I read a lot of reviews that the bass is not very good and that is true. However, unless you are an audiophile, you won't see much of a difference. The volume level in general is on the lower side but that's ok. It also has voice assistant feature and that's an added advantage.. Overall, I there are improvement areas but for 2k it's a steal especially if you want to use it for calls and some music. Also, with the right size of ear tips, the sound quality is quite good. One point : on my one plus 5, the equalizer feature is grayed out for bluetooth headset. Although it's not a pricked of the headset, I just wanted to highlight.

The 10 hour in 10 minute charge is real deal and not a marketing gimmick. I used it constantly throughout the day and had to charge it for maybe 15min/day.. Connection : The bluetooth v5 is really good and can handle maybe 15feet of distance before starting to crack up. Also switching between multiple devices is a piece of cake.. Cons:. Bass : If you're a bass head, you'll be disappointed.. Sweat resistance : The device has no official IP rating. And I can assert that it is not even sweat resistant. I ran wearing it only once and the buttons stopped working completely! Had to return it. (Later found out that this was a persistent issue with Bullets wireless 1 as well).. Build : The joint where the device ends and the wires begin is a bit suspicious! Not sure if it can handle rough use. Also the rubbery casing gets dirty easily..

Reviewed in India on 9 June 2020,Arghodeep Das,Unbeatable For The Price....,"I was Kinda Sceptical on How They Will be Considering That The Bullets Wireless 2 was launched at ₹5,999... But The One Plus Bullets Wireless Z is definitely The Best Option You Can Get.... Every Single Feature is Tested on My Redmi Note 7(4/64) which is a Budget Phone from Redmi of 2019. .. Build Quality:-The Build Quality is Good For The Price... Despite mainly Being Plastic its somewhat sturdy and the rubber neck band is very flexible and easy to carry. .. Comfort:-At First I was Able to Put on The Earphones for Long As It would start paining but after few hours i got used to it... Its just that the new design was not ok with me at first but after getting habituated its very good and i can use it for 2-3hrs in a strech but i will not recommend it coz the earbuds completely cover your ear passage thus blocking air passage which is not good... But As For Comfort its really good to wear. .. Sound Quality:-As Of Me Sound Quality is probably the Only Point which the One Plus Bullets Z is not As Strong as the other features of This... The Sound Quality is Good for an Average user... The Sound is Crisp and The Instrument Separation was Really On Point.. The Treble was nice but tends to get very slightly muffled at max volumes... The Bass is To Be Honest Not So Emphasised.. If you are a basshead(like me) you will feel like bass is almost not there... But By Applying The Largest Earbuds And Shifting Equalizer You can Get The Bass... After doing that The Sound Quality got kinda worse but The Bass was now Noticable and The Thump was there... All The Bollywood songs sounded nice on here... The Non-Lyrical songs are also good as well and you will feel its a Good Quality Earphones.... But Yes One Thing to Note :- The Sound Output While In YT or While In Call was like 10% Lower than It is suppose to be in my opinion. So In Terms of Sound :- If You Can Chnage a Couple of Things as i mentioned The Earphones can meet the expectation of a lot of Music Litseners out there. .. Call Quality:-The Call Quality is really good.. No Compliants The Other Person Can Hear Me Clearly so do i... But I felt that The Sound Output is marginally low as that what you would expect on a certaiy volume.... .. Battery Life and Charging:- This Earphones are literally awesome In Terms of battery life. I generally used these Earphones at 90%-80%. And it gave me 16-17hrs of battery life... (2.5hrs calling + 6hrs YT + 8hrs Music Playback) 3days of Usage time... In Terms of Charging... They Took Like 40mins to charge from 0 to 100 with my 5V-2A Charger which is incredibly fast for the battery life it offers.. And It Gave Me 8hrs of Battery(1hr call+3hrs YT+ 4hrs Music) after 10mins of Charging.. So I Guess a 18W fast Charger is enough To Meet The 10hr in 10mins claim. .. Important Note:-The Battery % of The Earphones are displayed wrong most of the time... I used it for 9hrs and it was still at 80% and after 12hrs of usage it was at 60%...but last 60% got used up in 4.5hrs which is incredibly wrong so don't think that 60% means it will last you like 10hrs or so... The representation of battery is incorrect and i don't whether it is my phone's problem or not...). .. Water Resistant:- Can't Comment coz i am not ready to try it coz if it gets damaged my father willl not buy me another one lol.... .. Bluetooth Range:-All I Can Say its Excellent... I Can Listen To Songs while being on The Ground Floor and My Phone While in The 1st Floor... .. Controls:-The Magnetic Controls and the Quick Switch Feature works flawlessly without any Problem so No Complaints..... .. Verdict:-This is So Far The Most Perfect and All Rounded Earphones you can Get at That Price... If Bass Quality Matters you The Most Plz Look For Other options as it might not make you fuly satisfied... But if you have no Problem with The Bass i Am Happy To Say This Earphones will not Let You down in any way.... They are awesome in every way. .. Hope I was Able To Help You With This Review.. ..

This is recomended product for every one as the quality and performance of product is very well. If you start using this it becomes like necklace as you will use this all the time. # Sound quality is crystal clear we can feel every instrument sound, and trebels also well controlled ,but in extra bass we should compromise for some. # Mainly its battery working very well and after full charge it lasts for more than 20 hours of continuous use. # i love the magnetic switch on/off( when you put them together they switch off to save battery power ,then when you need them , you just pull them apart and they're on and connected to your device within one second... And also quick switch option is very helpful to switch between two different devices simply in very less time .. 👉highly recommend for music lovers who loved to feel music not for extra bass Likers. ...............

Battery backup: gives 19 and half hours and more backup I tested it by my new stopwatch .. 10min charging for 10hrs is for OnePlus chargers but for ordinary chargers like I have it takes 50 min for the full charge. Magnetic on/off: very very fast it works. Connects very fast when seperated. Music quality : it has very nice music quality .it has clear music. Noise cancellation : not so good but not so bad.

While not using it, the wire reaches just below our chest and at the time, it gets hooked in the table, so every time when I don't use it, I hide it under my shirts.. 5.1. Have no place to hold the earphones at rest, just a small wire holder could have done the job. 6. No pouch included. 7. The charging cable is very short. just around 15 cm.. PROS (Advantages). 1. Amazing Battery backup, Out of the box it has 100% charge and used it for 3 days (more than 16 hours usage time). 1.1. Done the first charge only after 3 days, took only 52 minutes to charge from 0% to 100% (with 5v regular charger). 2. You do not need Oneplus Charger Adapter for it, Just regular 5v charger is enough (I used a 5v charger), 10 mins charger = 10 hours playback also works with regular 5v charger adaptor.. 3. Great comfort earpiece. not experienced any pain, (Continuously used for 4+ hours). 3.1. Do fit well on ears (for me, and I has used for cycling). 4.

Reviewed in India on 24 July 2020,Aniruddha,Great Bluetooth Headset for Price,"I have been using the Bullets Wireless Z since a month and have been quite satisfied.. Definitely recommend for OnePlus users looking for a cheap Bluetooth headset.. Pros:. 1) Easy to switch between two saved devices. 2) Connects quickly to OnePlus phones. 3) Turning them on and off is amazingly simple and quick.. Just need to pull them apart (Turn On) or put them back together (Turn Off). 4) Battery life is terrific. 5) Charges super fast. 6) Build quality seems solid. 7) Light-weight: Don't even notice I'm wearing the headset when not using it. Cons:. 1) The sound quality is average, not great but not bad. Definitely lack of bass for those looking specifically for it. 2) I have trouble sometimes when switching between the two saved devices but not sure if it's because of the earphones or the devices. 3) For my ears it isn't comfortable to wear for extended usage but this will vary from person to person. 4) Mic is too sensitive, picks up a lot of background noises. This is quite bad in my experience and the other person can barely hear my voice.. I would recommend to anyone looking for a relatively cheap Bluetooth headset for casual usage. It's extremely convenient and love all the features. Audiophiles should stay away. Also, if you plan to do a lot of voice calls, I suggest you look elsewhere, in my experience the mic picking up background noises will be a big problem but maybe it's just my headset.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 4 June 2020,shaik zaffar,Good for battery life and support wrap charging,"I had eagerly waited for the product sale in amazon .so after using this ear for a week I am writing a review. First go with pros:. 1) Battery: so one charge can give you a battery life of approximately 18.5 hrs.It take around 40 min for full charge.The most interesting part here is,as company said that 10 min charge will give you 10 hrs battery life(Note:you need to charge with wrap charger). 2) Build quality: So built quality is good.You can easily fit this in your tight pocket by folding. Coming to earpiece which is not made up metal.but thanks to magnet which holds the both earphones in your neck as well as it will pause your song when they are attached automatically. Cons:. 1)Bass: So at this price range you can get better base because this come with 9.2 mm drivers only.. 2) Connectivity: so I found the connectivity issue while placing a call with Google meet app.As well as switching from one device to another device also a pretty slow. CONCLUSION: whether you want to buy headset for long battery life and support fast charging just go for it. Else if you need a good base and better sound quality just go with Realme wireless headset which is available for around Rs.1700.Here you will get 11.2 mm drivers and build quality is also good.

The way they protrude out of my ears make it really difficult to use them in bed. The audio quality is good but it is not good for taking calls as it amplifies the background noises and is really annoying. Another con is that they get really loud but the sound level at the minimum is also too loud and if you want to hear something at low volume than they will surely give you a hard time.. Overall the battery life is amazing but with my 25 Watt Samsung charger it takes more than an hour to charge. Not everyone owns a oneplus device and spending a thousand bucks just for a charger is a foolish call. So the battery charging claims of 20 min are just for the oneplus users, rest everyone can easily anticipate around 1 to 1.5 hrs of charging time.. So to sum up my review,. Pros:. Good battery life. Good sound stage. Cons:. Fit is really uncomfortable in ears, especially if you use them in bed. Audio quality in calls is not good as the earphone amplifies every background noise it catches.

Reviewed in India on 3 July 2020,Sanketik Pradhan,Feels like a part of my mobile .,"Reviewing after using OnePlus Bullet wireless Z (OPBWZ) with my OnePlus 7T (OP7T) for 2 week. I have checked the audio quality with Mi note 5 pro also.. Pros :. 1- Battery life (18-19hr nattery backup with 25-30 mins charge. But you must use 30W charger supporting Dash charging). 2- Type C charger (No need to carry separate charging cable for my OPBWZ and OP7T). 3- Low latency mode improves your gaming experience (Low latency mode is available only in OnePlus devices enabling Fnatic mode). 4- Magnetic controls are awesome . Connecting two earpieces turns off your OPBWZ and after unconnecting it automatically turns on and connects with your phone within 3sec. (No need to go to Bluetooth section and to connect it manually. Thats why it feels like its a part of my mobile.). Cons:. 1-Sound quality not best . Bass and noise cancellation can be improved . (Only if you are non OnePlus mobile user). 2- Build quality is not that much premium. It is made up of totally Rubber and plastic material.But for this price range it is best.. 3- The charging port is open. I doubt if it is relally water resistant. There is no warrenty if by chance liquid goes inside your OPBWZ.. Finally I would like to say if you are using OnePlus device then its the best deal for you . You will get audio quality like 5-6k earphones . It is optimized for Oneplus devices (integrated for Dolby Atmos for better sound quality). You have to manually turn the option on in ""sound and vibration"" section.. Now if you use with other midranged mobile phones (like Mi note 5 pro or Realme phones) the audio quality is very poor as it is not optimized .",4.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 5 October 2020,Sunu F.,"Great battery life, bad bass (Old version) Meh bass - Bass edition","Bass edition review:. It does not support quick switch - so buyer beware. Apart from that the ""Bass Edition"" just means you get normal bass. Its slightly better than the normal edition - but at the sacrifice of the quick switch which was the main attraction of the Bullet. I would suggest using the normal version and an app to tweak equalizer settings. This version is not worth it... The modified 2 star rating is for the false advertising by Oneplus as they advertise the quick switch on their website.. Old model review:. I looked at reviews over the internet before picking these up. While most reviewers said the bass was adequate in my experience it was really really really poor. I don't really need thumping bass - but this was more of a tin can unless you listen at really high volume levels.. I sorted the issue on my android phone with an app called ""Bass Boost"" which allowed me to tweak the bass to acceptable standards. The iPad/iOS, because of Apples crazy policies, is not possible without Jailbreaking though.. Battery life is great and you can easily get a week of use at a couple of hours a day. If you can get an EQ app to tweak the sound its a great headset.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 27 February 2021,Private,Stay away from these if you care for your ears,"I had very high hopes for these Bluetooth earphones. Especially after watching the reviews and the ratings it has got.. Pros - 1. Build quality is decent as per the price. 2. Option to switch between 2 devices is a handy feature that every Bluetooth earphone should have.. 3. Battery life.. Cons - 1. Pathetic sound quality (It is not about the base but the overall sound output you get is very bad).. 2. Call quality issues(fluctuation in the volume during the call).. 3. I did not like the fitting of these in-ear types which is very uncomfortable during long calls/meetings and it hurts the ears. (I tried all the size of earbuds but it’s just that I ear types are not good for my ears). Conclusion - I am really shocked that how can such a cheap-sounding(both for music and calls) earphones get such a good rating. Now I strongly believe it’s due to PR. One plus does market their products nicely and their packaging is great too, but it does not justify the primary use case I.e listening to music or calling. Having a good battery with additional features is a secondary thing.. I tried paring with android and iPhone both and it had the same issues. For eg. If there is an incoming call, it will start ringing in your ears at the highest volumes for a couple of seconds before it becomes normal, but the damage to your ears has already been done. The same thing happens when the call disconnect sound comes. And the quality of the audio is pathetic. When it comes to music, ₹250 Philips wired earphones sound better.. Don’t go for it if you want to avoid any damage to your ears.. The better option would be to invest in a good wired earphone such as apple or Sennheiser at the same price range.. Sad to see companies(especially Chinese) copying each other and putting all resources towards branding.. And we as a customer should not fall under these gimics..

Reviewed in India on 26 June 2020,Venkatesh,Definitely not worth the price,"Edit: The left earcups are already degraded after 1 month of use. (See pictures). Yeah, I am as surprised as you for writing this review. I always trusted OnePlus to deliver top quality products, and they did, most of the time, but not on this one. I would say the wireless z are average at best even if they sell it for 50% off, but with a 2k price tag, they are definitely not worth it.. ""BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BATTERY LIFE? YOU ARE JUST COMPLAINING NEEDLESSLY"". I agree the battery life of the earphones are one of a kind in the market. You do get (almost)10hrs playtime for 10 mins of charge . But having a 20hr battery won't make up for all the other aspects which are moderately adequate at best.. ""THE BASS IS VERY LOUD AND GOOD, THOUGH"". Let me tell you a secret. With a little help from a top-secret tool called an equaliser, you can get ""loud"" bass from a 600rs earphone (Thank you, technology). I will get a lot of flak for this, but you really won't see a (major) difference in bass quality.. ""THE EARPHONE QUALITY FEELS PREMIUM"". I really don't know how a ""premium"" earphone ""feels"". Most earphones are made of plastic compounds and so is this. If you really care about the external quality, the Wireless Z are above average of a typical 600rs earphone. But if you don't have the habit of throwing your earphones often, you should be fine with a cheaper one.. ""THEY ARE EASY TO WEAR AND COMFORTABLE"". Comfortable, resounding no. The wireless Z has two (heavy) battery packs on either side. So if you plan to wear this for more than 2 hrs straight, expect moderate pain or discomfort in your ears because the battery packs will weigh your ears down. The weight is so much that if you bend backwards, the earphones will fall right off (Thank you, 20hrs battery life). I guess you could wear it the prescribed way, wherein you loop the wire around your ears and then plug them, but no one does that and it's too much.. ""THE SOUND QUALITY IS TOP-NOTCH THOUGH"". Sound quality is definitely not above average. If you want to watch movies, the audio is on par to that of cheaper earphones. If you listen to music, the difference in quality is barely noticeable. If you wear them while gaming, don't expect crisp audio like headsets.. ""THE EARPHONES SWITCH ON WHEN YOU SEPARATE THE EARPODS. HOW INNOVATIVE."". I don't get it, really. It does save 3 seconds while switching on, but to switch it off you have to bring the pods together. Why not just make a button for that? The wireless z does have 3 buttons. But counter intuitively, the middle one is for pause, next song and previous song, all functioned into one button, and the other two are solely for volume. There's another on the left battery pack which is for ""pairing with the last device and resetting"" but I've not used it once.. OnePlus has really dropped the ball on this. Maybe, they had the utter confidence that consumers would buy this product if they leveraged just one aspect-the battery life-and it worked. We were so excited about the battery that we didn't question the price and by doing so we validated every other average feature the Wireless Z offered for a more than average price tag.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Everybody's worry ""Hey is that sweatproof or waterproof? "" well coming to that note there is a difference between water resistance and proof, resistance is just a measure till what range the device can handle the water and proof is the device was made to use underwater, for example, an underwater camera well the bullet z is IP55 that means its ability to handle a splash of water or your workout sweat. The technical stuff is the best stuff here this has a 9.2mm dynamic driver and super bass tone fitted in each earbud, Bluetooth 5.0, quick switch, aptx & SBC codec the quick switch is one of my favorite feature of all I just de-attach and voila connected within a second its the same experience when you use the fingerprint scanner to unlock your OnePlus phones the base quality is powerful but not equally powerful to rip your eardrums apart, the volume is powerful and the connection remains stable when I am 10 meters apart or in another room which is what I need to answer all my zoom calls with a breeze this also have a memory function it only connects to the last know connected device but you can override and click on the quick switch button to go to the 2nd last known device.

Pros:. - Fit is decent - it takes some time to get used to but once you get it, you get it.. - I own a OnePlus 7T so pairing was like magic.. - Switching between iPad Air 3 and OnePlus 7T again was super easy.. - Music volume and quality is pretty decent (if you are an audiophile - please raise your budget).. - Charges really quick. It's all true.. - Latency is literally negligible (Streaming Netflix, Spotify etc). - You can sleep wearing it (I Did, and it was comfortable).. - Under recommended volume it should be great.. Cons:. - The fit within my ear is not all that great. I think the buds are harder than they may seem. Nothing beats Sennheiser comfort in that department.. - The mint is nothing like the pictures. It's slightly dull and faded. It's alright because it's bound to get dirty - but I was expecting something brighter. Slightly let down, to be honest.. - storage is going to be an issue. Despite reviews (which are mostly paid I feel) - the wires don't look too strong to me - I think they can be damaged easily.. - while running you might want to make sure the neckband does not slip too far behind - the whole thing might come off.. For OnePlus 6 and above users - Go for it. Good in this budget and the charging speed is the real USP for me. And the sound is good despite what reviews say.

A really time saver features if you want to use these earphones with your laptop while still plugged in your phone.. Cons. 1) I feel the loudness could have been a little more.. 2) The plastic build is a bit off putting.. 3) Being a Bluetooth earphone it has a major disadvantage of high latency, even though these pairs are designed to give low latency, I can still pick some slight audio delays while watching movies.. 4) It would have been great if the sound signature could be a little better..

Reviewed in India on 20 July 2020,Sarthak,Good with a lack of bass.,"It's a good pair of wireless earphones. I will briefly describe the pros and the cons:-. Pros:-. 1) The Quick Switch feature is just like a dream come true. I switch between my phone and laptop throughout the day and its extremely handy.. 2) Battery Life and charging speed:- I got the earphones fully charged and just to check the battery life I tried to drain the battery to 0 and it lasted for me 3 consecutive days(It might be because I use them at around 20% volume). I guess I used more than 20 hours and then it took around 25mins to full charge. That's great. 3) Build quality of wires, soft wires are always great and it comes with that. Also, I never faced any skin irritation even after wearing it throughout the day.. 4) Fit:- In my ears they fit perfectly, I also used them during cycling and jogging(even in covid times, lol) and they never fell off.. Cons. 1) The biggest:- The white light keeps flashing in every 5 seconds and if you use them during lights off, lol, you are going to make 'Ek kahani aisi bhi' in your mind. I checked for solutions on forums, but found none.. 2) Bass:- Though I am not a bass head, I felt it lacked the punch. Vocals are excellent in my opinion( I usually listen to the show Ek kahani aisi Bhi and listen Pop music and they felt excellent.. 3) Made in China(though I dont have any problem with that) your friends gonna text you or say to you when they see it's from a chinese manufacturer. 😂😂😂",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 15 December 2020,Utsab Roy,Long term review (After 3 months),"I have been using the one plus bullets wireless z for almost 3 months now.. I would like to point out few points:. Sound quality: Sound quality is really really good. I had lots of faith on One Plus and they did an amazing job in that. Noise Cancellation: There is enough noice cancellation, to block off all chitter chatter around you while you are listening to music. Very loud noises can still be heard. Don't expect special noise cancellation at this price point, but its decent enough on these earphones.. Bass Quality: Bass is really a very main point for choosing our headphones and earphones nowadays. Even though while I was having a dilemma reading the rest of the reviews, that the one plus bullets wireless z lacks in bass, I would like to go ahead and say confidently that, it's bass is just perfect, and you will love it. It's thump has been optimised so that you can hear for longer time. But I am pretty sure there are equalizers available in almost all smartphones and music apps, and with a slight twitch you will be able to get back the thump you want. When connected with laptops, the bass is just perfect. Don't worry about it just go for it.. Mic Quality: I am just amazed at the microphone quality of the earphones, they are just awesome. From the moment I have started wearing these earphones I always prefer receiving calls over these only. Sound is just clear.. Water resistant: Yes, it is sweat and dust resistant and I use it daily for sprinting (and workout), and I out of all people, sweat very much, and I have not yet seen any problems in the earphones because of coming in contact with my sweat..

Coming to call experience: It's not good. There's clarity BUT alot of environmental noises. In comparison, the WI-C200 was alot better..

I mean, you can clearly notice it while playing 'Rockstar by DaBaby or The Box by Roddy Ricch or Animals by Martin Garrix' I mentioned these songs because these songs are bass heavy & do use EQFY for actual BASS TEST. So this was a major issue, due to which I have placed an return for this product.. ALSO, the build or structure of the model is quite weird. Tbh I didn't liked it that well..

Bluetooth connectivity is very good especially if you own a OnePlus phone, although at times, I've noticed that it doesn't connect automatically, and I have to do it manually.

But after tuning my Equalizer according to my preferences on my 7T, the bass sounds pretty good, more like a 7/10. So my suggestion is, if you're a bass lover like me, you can get decent bass out of this by adjusting your Equalizer settings.. Quite handy when it comes to using them while working out as well, as they don't slip off your ears that easily. I'm a person who sweats a lot as well, so I'm pretty impressed with how it has coped with that, too.. Call quality is alright for me, the position of the mic could make it difficult for the person on the other end to hear what we're saying at times, so I literally have to remove my left ear piece while making calls, and keep the mic next to my mouth so that the other person can listen to me talking.. Built quality is very good, and like I said, it's pretty sweat resistant too. Battery life is awesome too, and comfortably lasts for around 16-18 hours for me..

But still there's one thing about this product which doesn't give me any choice but to return this product. The problem is connection issues with the devices.

Reviewed in India on 13 September 2020,Paratyaksh Singh,"If you don't have a One plus phone , there is no need to buy it!!","The form factor or build quality of the earphones is quite good. The noise cancellation is also great but the problem lies in its utter lack of music experience, there are other earphone sets under 2000 which provide better music experience than the Bullet Z. It may be because of a compatibility issue between the Redmi Note 9 Pro and the Bullet Z but the sounds are not as comprehensive as they come in the Realme Bluetooth earphones or in Boat as a matter of fact. They both outperformed Bullet Z in terms of music experience. I had to buy a wired earphone after it. My suggestion is not to buy below ₹4000 in the Bluetooth earphones segment instead go for wired sets like Sennheiser Cx275 or Sony. One Plus is an amazing brand I have no hard feelings towards them but as desperately as people want to join the ""Red Cable Club"", don't join it through Bullet Z.
