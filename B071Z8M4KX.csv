The earpieces also fit tightly into the ears and seem on the harder side. They will never fall off from the ears. Sound quality is above average as compared to their next product in the hierarchy.

Reviewed in India on 8 December 2018,Demander,Okay,"Okay product. Will comment in 3-6 months regarding durability.. These are supposed to be basshead earphones but I don't think they qualify - not at their price range.. They don't really boost bass just amplify it and make the entire lower range frequency louder. As a result, if you go above the halfway volume mark, the sound sort of starts cracking and hurting ears. The problem goes away a bit when you tweak the sound settings. However, the range is small. If you optimize settings for bass, then treble starts cracking, and if you optimise for middle range sounds (can't really get a good treble), then bass starts cracking. Just not satisfactory for me.. Of course, everyone's taste in music is different and their requirements from earphones are different. Obviously, I listen to everything from Opera and Death metal to bluegrass and hip-hop to rap and jazz to Punjabi upbeat songs and Ghazals. So this earphone covers only a fraction of all that and hence I do not particularly like them even for the price of rs 379 that I paid in the lightning deal. There were a few cheaper earphones that were much better than these and I only bought this because they were out of stock.. However, if your taste in music covers a narrow frequency range and similar genres and you just want loud percussion sounds and don't care about much else, go for it.. As for watching TV shows and Movies, earphones generally don't affect the experience that much unless they are too good or too bad. However, here too, I find that the sound gets annoying if the volume is too high and I cannot eat while watching because it amplifies the sound of my jaw too much. Plus it makes everything sound a little weird. But I guess the last part gets adjusted with use.. All in all, I will try a different pair next time. I mainly checked the reviews and bought them because they were rated high on durability. If they break soon, then there will be no point in me ever buying them again. I will see how long they last.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Sound burn in is extremely important and no one reviews that way because everyone will just buy and plugin and give the reviews the drivers need to be calibrated for any speaker earphone headphone anything for a minimum of 20hrs. I have kept it on olaymode for more than 8 hrs now and this is really good. Bass is real good and serves the purpose very very well..

I write this, after having used Mi red phones which are in the same price range -300-400/-. 1. The ear buds are too small and don't give you that tight grip feel. It will fall off in the slightest of activity. 2. Position of mic: The mic is situated very low, at the point of intersection between 2 strings. It literally falls till you lower chest. So while talking on phone you have to hold the mic up manually near your mouth. In Mi earphones mic is placed near the right ear string, at a height near your face. That makes it easy to talk while earphones are on.. 3. The connecting cable at the point where you plugin to your phone is too long. That makes it prone to a lot of bending..

Now what is bad let me tell that plus minus volume button u really miss during journey or in other case. While on using microphn u hve to pick it little up near ur mouth bcz its mic too much lower from ur neck.. Generally in all earphones upto 10k we se that at very higher & lower volume (say abv 12/15 or below 3/15) we have issue of treble & bass so let me tell this prblm is general in all earphones below 10k so for common people this is not so much big issue. The issue is at higher vol the earphn bass u r expecting is come with ""khar khar ""sound u feel like ur earphn vibrates too much unnecessary sound. And in very lower volume u do not feel any bass. In treble mode only (high freq 5,10,15,20kHz only are set at 10dB in equalizer) u feel pain & irritation in ur side head nerves.. So if we r talking abt vol abv 3/15 to below 12/15 this earphn are marvellous at cost 349.. Also don't buy white piece bcz they become dirty & looks very bad ugly & old so go for black colour.. don't think abt cable got damaged after some time bcz of its round design & not flat ; i think for 1 year there will be no damage unless if u not broke it forcefully..

Given the price, the sound quality is great, the bass is emphasized but the mids and highs are not drowned out. The build quality is also surprisingly good. The cable from the mic to the 3.5mm jack is especially thick. The right earpiece came apart at one point but I was able to fix it easily with some super glue and I haven't had any other problems so far. I find these are far better value than the Sennheiser CX 180 (which used to be my preferred budget earphones), these sound almost as good and cost only about half the price.

Reviewed in India on 28 June 2019,Nilanjan ,Boat Bassheads 100 vs JBL C50HI,"A few days ago I decided to buy a earphone within the sum of rupees 500. When I saw the earphones on Amazon it was difficult to me to choose between Boat Bassheads 100 and JBL C50HI. I was confused. So I bought both of them and after using for 2 days I returned one of them.. In the next day after ordering the Boat Bassheads 100 was arrived. I used it. It is nice. Build quality was not too much durable as expected in this type of budget. Also wires are not tangle free. Its 3.5 mm pin is not L-Shaped so it's provide some pain when you plugged it in with the mobile and put the mobile in the pocket. Sound quality is nice but little bit much louder with full sound. Bass is lower than I expected. The main problem is the mic. The mic is little bit far from your lips so when you need to talk you have to hold it with your hand near to your mouth, it is a pain when talking with someone for a long over earphone. This headphone easy fit in my ear but it becomes uncomfortable when using continuously for over an hour. Earbuds are also uncomfortable while laying on the bed.. After two days of ordering JBL C50HI was delivered to me. Build quality is same with the Boat Bassheads 100. But JBL C50HI has a L-shaped 3.5 mm pin which is comfortable option to plug it in when your phone is in the pocket. Sound quality is more than I expected. Too clear, balanced and pleasant sound. Not too loud just the perfect balance. Bass is superb. The mic of this JBL earphone is placed just beside your lips so you don't need to hold it with your hand while talking with someone over earphone. It is also a perfect fit in my ear and too comfortable for long time usage. I also used it while laying on the bed for more than 3 hours continously it is perfect. In this JBL earphone's earbuds marked with 'L' & 'R' so it is easy to discover that which one will fit in which ear. I just love this one.. Therefore I returned the Boat Bassheads 100. Hence I will suggest you to buy the JBL C50HI if you confused between the former and latter.. But remember Boat has a 1 year warranty and JBL has a 6 months warranty. Your choice.",4.0 out of 5 stars

It has been around 9 months now that I've been using these earphones and they have been upto the price I paid for them. I have use a number of earphones including JBL, Philips, Sony etc, and this product super-seeds every basic model of these 'brands'. I usually use them while watching movies, making calls, listening music, making skype calls, i.e, all the basic stuff an earphone is used for and never have I ever faced any problem.. I have been looking over internet for other models as well but the worst part is most of them had a number of complaints about not working after a use of around 6 months. For the last 9 months, I have used these for more than 4 hours per day on an average, carried them in bag with other stuff like keys, comb, pens etc. but they still work just fine.. Now.. Should you buy it?. The answer to this, pretty much boils down to your need and budget.. Who should purchase it?. Someone who just wants a pair of earphones that plays the sound decently enough and lasts long at a minimum expense.. Who shouldn't buy it?. If you want every last details of your music crystal clear with all the bass then you should go for some high end product from complies like Sony, JBL, Bose.. If you have a budget of more than Rs 1000 then you can certainly find a better pair than this one, in terms of sound quality.. Hope this review has helped you in making a decision for your purchase.

You get the earphones in the box , a carrying pouch, two extra pairs of earbuds , a warranty card and a boat pamplet .. Quality -. The wire quality is good , but near the drivers the wire is little thin . I think you should use it carefully not roughly .. Features -. You get nothing extra .. It's a normal earphone it have a controller to reject,answer calls and to play pause music.. Mic -. It's pretty decent mic , if you think you can make YouTube videos from the mic you are wrong , it's only for calls.. DRIVERS (the part which you insert in your ears) -. The drivers fit in your ears so that you cannot hear the outer noise . Bass is very high, sound is crisp and clear.. DESIGN - the product have a hawk design which appears big in the photos but it is not that much big.. The body is made up of plastic which seems durable but they can make it metal design . It have a 3.5 mm jack which is not gold plated.. PROS & CONS. Pros -. Stylish design. High bass. Excellent sound quality. Cons -. Wire is too thin. Plastic body not metal. Result -.

I have bought Stone 200 and Stone grenade previously.. Talking about this Mid-Range InEar headphone/earphone, this is fabulous.. Design and Build Quality: No Gold Plated audio jack (no one cares of it) but the jack is covered with soft rubber which may give that joint a better strength. Cord quality is well enough. Has a dedicated mic in it with a single button which works well. Now the earbuds have such an ergonomic design that will feel you good and has rubber joint over there as well. So it will make it stronger. So overall it is strong enough.. Sound Quality: Fabulous!! All 3 ranges are so well that you can put them on for hours without feeling any headache(it is tested by me for 5 hours). Noice cancellation works also very good. You can experience it while playing PUBG or on a call.. Gaming Experience: I do play PUBG Mobile using it and overall it is good. Even on its maximum volume, you won't feel them SCREAMY and mic also works well in that. My only problem with it is if you are pushing the audio jack to any direction, you may feel that one of your earbud will stop working. It may be my phone's fault but I'm just telling its just a pin, not a screw which is fixed. So make sure you check your phone if the jack will get interrupted or not while holding your phone..

Reviewed in India on 25 December 2018,Brijesh Singh,MY,"Just received today, I am sharing the initial impression after a couple of hours of use. It can be very helpful for you to decide how worthy the product is and should you buy it or not. After using it for a while I noticed that the build is not that good. It's completely plastic made, no metal rings and the wire is not of untangled type. It can tangle if u r not tying it properly. And the wire is thin so u would have to see to it that you are handling it properly. It is light weight and that's probably because it is sports friendly. It can get easily tucked inside the ears and the fit is nice. It will remain in the ear even if you are using it while running, dancing or during any such events. The warranty card comes inside the box that you can use for availing warranty as the contact details have been listed on it. Overall durability seems to be an issue if you are a very rough user. However I can say it would last a good time if you are regularly tying and keeping it in a bag or any such case or pouch after every use. Sound quality is awesome, not like those high end ones but still for the price it's good. That is one thing that I really about it. Now it says it has noise cancellation and it works really nice. That is also because it has been given a slight angle for the buds to get inside the ear a bit more than the regular ones making it to be giving a complete sound experience without annoying noise. The Bass is good, can't say it is wonderous or will take you to heaven, its just good and you would actually notice the real bass when the volume is turned up to Max. However that might cause irritation and ear pain as the loudness hypes up to making the song a piece of noise so I suggest using it at a moderate value. Mic is not that good. However it can be used for regular stuffs like attending calls. It can't be used for professional purposes like making YouTube videos. Again, that's completely your choice to use it as a primary mic for your stuffs.. I have described what I noticed and got to know. You should also consider other reviews.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I was taken aback with the sound quality on these; the bass is really hard hitting on these. It can get a little overwhelming sometimes, so make sure you adjust the same from your phone Equalizer. The button feels tactile and easy to navigate. The wire could have been flat, or tangle free. It is thicker than usual, yes, but a flat wire would have made it feel better. The design is refreshing, the dual tone on the button and the earphones themselves are a treat to behold. I got the black ones, and the effect is much more noticeable on it.. All in all, in under 500, these earphones are the best you could have. Except maybe the Basshead 220, and 225 if you can get them.
