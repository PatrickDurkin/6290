Reviewed in India on 30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,boAt 225 vs JBL CS100 vs Sennheisers cx180 | DETAILED Comparison after 1 YEAR of USE.,"NOTE:. @ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.. @ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.. @ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.. I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,. BUILT QUALITY :. ------------------. ● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.. ● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.. Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.. ● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.. ●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●. COMFORT :. ------------. ● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.. ● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.. ● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.. ●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●. LOUDNESS :. -------------. CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI. ● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.. ● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.. ● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.. ●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●. SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :. ---------------------------------------------. I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.. ● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.. ● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.. ● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.. ●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●. SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :. ----------------------------------. ● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.. ● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.. ● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P. NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.. ●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●. CUSTOMER CARE :. --------------------. ● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.. ● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.. ● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.. NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.. ●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●. CONNECTIVITY :. ------------------. All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.. VERDICT :. ----------. I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.. Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.. Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.. But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.. I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.. Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.. Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.. But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.. I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.. In short I am the king of bad luck in this.. Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.. Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.. I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.. But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.. Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled man. But still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.. And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.. But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.. Ahh the moment let me share with you guys she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.. We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.. But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.. Whole night I will awake and very stressed.. Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.. She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.. She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.. But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.. She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.. I know her past she was love in some man.. Who is more than double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life..

Now lets talk directly about the pros and cons of it .. Pros:--. 1. Quality Sound --- Yes But with few exceptions. 2. Pumping Bass --- Yes but with a condition and that is you must Download the song with best quality possible and Volume level must be atleast 50% - 65% only then you will feel it but since its common for almost every earphones so not a big deal even APPLE EARPODS NEEDS IT. 3. Noise Cancellation ---- Definitely Yes. 4 Comfort ---- Great , can be used even if laying on bed, no issues at all. 5.Durability --- Actually Good with Tangle Free cable. 6. Inline Mic --- Works Perfectly with its Multi Role Button. Cons:-. 1. Weight - Slightly Heavier as compared to other earphones but not like some reviewer has mentioned like it keeps falling always , you just need the right earbuds and to add further extra hooks has been provided but then not recommended for workouts specially if you are doing cardio excercise.. 2. Looks--- Not SuperCool But then its manageable. 3. No Volume Control.. 4.After Prolonged use of regularly for 2-3 hrs for 2 months ,u may start feeling little uncomfortable and slight pain but again if u use it alot like me. Overall Verdict - Definitely Go For It considering the price and the sound quality also if you want MIC And can Ignore the Volume Control Buttons, I can say its a good alternative for apple earpods and as long as Boat keeps making these kind of products within these affordable prices i dont have to shift back to earpods..

I tried the earphones on my laptop as well as on ma y of my phones.the bass is just bad, really bad. The retailer who sent this piece to me sent a duplicate one. Shame on those pathetic losers. Just for the sake of 500 rupees, they threw their reputation out of the window. I did not expect such cheaply product from Amazon - the supermarket online store owned by the wealthiest jeff bezos. Unfortunately, ithrew the packaging away as soon as I unboxed the product and that is why I cannot go for a replacement. But really, to the seller - you disgust me",4.0 out of 5 stars

I'm not an audiophile, but compared to other cheap earphones, this one is far superior in both physical and audible quality. The wire shows no signs of stress or strain even after 6 months of use. The audio also sounds (and feels) very good, as does the bass. Also has a mic and a button, which most earphones don't seem to have these days. Comes with extra earbuds, a clip, and earhooks. The wires are flat, which means very low chances of them entangling.. Worse part is that due to the quality, it is quite heavy, making it fall out of your ears. Thankfully, you can adjust the earbuds and make use of provided clip and hooks, but being light would've been better. Couple of months after purchase the volume dropped badly due to some internal problem, but it (almost) fixed itself a week later. I still hear some static on high bass, though, which is a shame for a ""BassHead"".. All in all, it worked better than any other earphone I've bought so far, and seems like it will for a lot more time.. (I see the rate has increased now.

Boat promised what they say out of box ‘ Extraaaa Bass’, the Bass of these headphones are really high compared to others. An overall the sound output of this headphones are very high. During my test, I found these headphones have good audio quality compare to others at this price. If you like EDM and pop songs, then you love these Boat headphones. But I suggest reducing a volume of your phone while listening Sufi and romantic songs because by default these headphones have higher volume, so you didn’t feel clear audio. The once again Bass effect is really good with treble and vocal. You can easily distinguish between different instruments & sounds which are good for extra bass.. ◆◆◆Comfort◆◆◆. When coming to comfort, first I am not very impressed with these headphones, but after a select right pair of ear tips, I feel better. If you use this boat headphones for a long time, then you feel a little bit awkward because of big capsule design. On the Noise Isolation, Boat BassHeads 225 are very good. Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation & comfort. I use these headphone while bike driving and I weren’t able to hear outside noise, that’s really amazing.

I work in the Film industry where the sound is one of the most essential elements and no matter whether you have or have not, a good earphone is a must.. Apple gives good earphones but they break after a while but the sound quality they provide is excellent. The problem is that first, they are super expensive and second, they don't last long.. Most other earphones in the same range will give far inferior product and their sound quality is so bad that it will only damage your eardrums and give your headaches. Here is a detailed view of why I find the Boat earphones to be one of. the best that there is –. ------. Pros.  If you are ordering from Amazon, then you have a well packed good product in your hands. I have also found that I am unable to find the Boat products easily in the general market..  Wires are like strap, flat and very strong. Unlike earphones which gives you a rubbery feeling, these earphones will give you more of a plastic feeling..  The wire does not coil itself and if it does, it is easy to open it because of the of the smooth strapped flat shape of wires..  The sound is amazing. It does not break even when I took the volume a little higher..  They are easily stuck on ears and does not fall off..  The wire is long enough for you to put laptop one side and watch movies from a distance..  The microphone is also awesome as I sang songs and made voice notes, for which it was clear and precise. Sometimes more than required. It even captured my breathing sound from a distance..  The earbuds have a metallic look and are strong. There is no question you have to buy another earphone for an entire year..  It comes with an entire set of different custom earbud covers. It helps because different people have different ear sizes and according to them they can use it for their ears. It also comes with cervical ear support which helps in putting an earbud to connect more impactfully to your ear without giving you pain. It helps if you don’t want earbuds to fall in case of strong movements..  Most important, though the price is less, the boat products do not look very cheap and boasts of a good brand name.. ------. Cons.  Are you kidding me? Till now there are no cons for me. With the price tag attached to it, it is literally the best bargain you can get on an earphone. My brother has two of them in different colours and loves them.. ------. Final Opinion. Don’t think twice before ordering it. There are tremendously good reviews all over for Boat products and lately, I have seen more and more people leaning towards this product. I cannot tell you how many people have recommended me this earphone and those friends of mine have never faced any problem of any kind..

Reviewed in India on 28 April 2019,Vivek,Don't buy this if you want to enjoy music,"The product does not do justice to the high ratings. It is not as good as others make it seem. I am an audiophile and I have used tens of headphones and earphones, and it is one of the worst I have used.. Pros. 1. It is not expensive and hence most can afford it.. 2. It has really good bass, and hence if that's the only thing you need, go ahead.. 3. It is sturdy as the earpieces are made of metal. Falling on the ground doesn't harm it any way. Even sitting on it by mistake won't do any damage. Better than plastic earpieces in that regard.. Cons. 1. The sound quality is horrible after you go above 50% volume. It sounds like those cheap speakers in marriage halls.. 2. The volume at full capacity is very very loud, loud enough to make one partially deaf.. 3. The worst of it all. It is very heavy and hence starts hurting the ears within a few minutes of usage.. 4. It has very poor noise cancellation unless you literally stuff it inside your ear canal which hurts even more.. 5. It is definitely not a product for lon term usage as you will always have pain in your ear canal and may also damage your eardrums if played at higher volumes..

The metal casing and tangle free flat wires are something only very expensive earphones have, so a good thumbs up to BoAt for providing this at such an aggressive price.. Talking about comfort, i didn't like them much honestly. They were decent at best. Neither uncomfortable nor very comfortable. Just manageable.. Coming to the sound quality, now this is the tricky part.. Some people will love it, some will hate it.. Bass is quite good for the price. They're punchy and if you're an EDM fan or love those thumps in every music, this is the one to go with.. The vocals were simply not good. Because of the extra bass, they get muffled up. So while you'll enjoy Badshah ke hiphops, Arijit Singh songs are something you'll not really like on these.. Overall ratings:. Build 9/10. Comfort 8/10. Sound:. Bass: 9/10. Vocals: 6/10. Treble 7/10.

Reviewed in India on 24 July 2019,Parshati,Good budget earphones.,"I had initially received a damaged product and amazon replaced it without hassle. The packaging is neat and compact, comes with all the 3 sizes of earbuds in two colours so you get a total of 6 pairs of them.. The product in itself is decent and worth the price paid. Now we can't expect the bass and noise cancellation of the high end over the ear headphones that cost at least 10x more. The button at the mouthpiece starts and stops music and disconnects calls efficiently. The flat cord ensures that you don't tangle the headphones as much as you otherwise would have (it's a huge pro for me cause I personally suck at untangling wires.) It overall looks and performs way better than the other earphones at this price point. So if your budget is under ₹500/- I'd suggest you get these without hesitation.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I was a bit skeptical over The title on the box 'Super EXTRAAAA Bass' as I don't like 'too much bass' destroying. every other notes of the song/music. But the slight rumbling, extended bass delivered impressed me.. IDK if its for 'Bassheads' but its definitely not for flat listeners.. Soundstage is a bit below average.. The mids and the treble area are straight forward muddy, it doesn't have the sharpness there,. and the identification of individual instruments are muffled. Overall I'd give the sound quality a positive sign obviously. considering the price.. 4)The single Pause/Play button is embedded into the microphone chasis, so like the entire plastic body part is a. switch, you don't have search for the switch with your thumb.. And thumbs up for the L-shaped 3.5mm jack.. 5)Lastly, The packing is good. Expect a carrying pouch we get 3 sets of Black earbuds, 3 sells of Red-transparent earbuds.. A clip. Pair of clamp (to support into ear).. Using the black earbuds might provide you a little more comfort but I found the sound gets muffled a bit. Cons: Now sadly from here on in my review, everything goes downhill upto a really deal breaking point.. 1)Its UNCOMFORTABLE!!!. it hurts badly in my ear. No matter what earbuds I tried, with or without the clamp or. the clip, it hurts.. Specially when you are on the go, because of its long heavy metallic body of the earpieces.. Ok this experience should not be generalized, as some people out there might find a particular setup to achieve the proper. isolation, fit and comfort. but not me. And I CAN'T recommend this product in that regard.. 2)Isolation inside ear is poor, and as it hurts you can't put it into ear for long period also.. 3)The microphone is bad, you always have to keep it close to your mouth even in a relatively less noisy condition.. And no volume rocker.. *)The Tangle-free wire is really tangle free but how it feels against the skin (specially when sweaty) is not as comfy as. the braided cable. Its a matter of choice what you like. personally I like the fabric textured braided cable over this. Already sold this to a friend 2nd hand. So no further updates..

Reviewed in India on 7 August 2020,Rohit RK,Wearing upsidedown into the ears for comfort while sitting but still uncomfortable while resting.,"It's been 2yrs since purchased. Still boom sound as I maintain my accessories with care. Sound quality is just exceptional for the price range. I wear them upside down with the help of the provided clip for ample comfort. I don't use earhooks. Bass is solid & thumping. Doesn't feel any dampness or amplification at any volume level. Just pure thumping sound.. One thing that I wished is that I should be able to use them while resting. They are just fine in as long as I am sitting or walking, but while resting, they tend to create discomfort even in the upside down position inserted in the ears. & only due to this reason, I sometimes begin searching for other earphones.

The packaging is really very good. It won't let you feel about the low price of the product.. Previously, I always used to prefer Sony earphones only. My last one was MDR-XB70 which is a very expensive one. But the sound quality was good enough to make you feel proud about the money spent on them. Undoubtedly, my ears are habituated to quality sound and bass output. The Sony earphone is not working right now and I'm a bit out of budget for an expensive alternative. After days of research and analysis, I took a risk and gave BOAT 225 Bass Heads a shot.. After connecting it to my phone I was utterly mesmerised by the sound quality it is offering at this price point. Trust me, I'm a bit sceptical about these things. The price is too low to be compared to other high-quality earphones out there in the market. The bass output is awesome. The highs are not that well balanced but considering the price, it's just an awesome product. The build quality is great and you can't expect more. It's true that the earphones are heavy and will tend to come out. The ear tips provided with the earphones are very hard and not at all comfortable. My previous ear tips from Sony came handy in this situation. Thus, I'm saved ;P..

Reviewed in India on 18 February 2019,Amazon Customer,Nice but also very irritating,"Pros: To be completely honest, the sound quality of these earphones really IS AWESOME. the bass is actually pretty much the best and it gives you a great sound quality. the wire also seem very strong and is tangle free mostly.. Cons: But if you are someone who wud appreciate some peace of mind to come handy with ur habit of listening to music then these earphones are a big NO, only and only because of the earbuds. Since they are made of metal, these earbuds are pretty heave which means that literally every single minute one or the other earbud will keep slipping out of ur ears atleast twice and all ur time and attention will go in to fixing that CONTINOUSLY. Yes, they do provide some sort of earbud holder in the package.. but good luck using them. Because if you use dem they will just end up hurting ur ears after just 15-20 minutes or they will just get lost like they did in my case.. In conclusion: Trust me guys, its a real problem. These earphones are so good that i would have never had anything bad to say about these earphones, if it wasn't giving me such a hard time with just staying in my ears.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Box : nice package you get 6 different ear tips and a ear type of hooks(4/5). Quality:::. Sound - truly clear and lound rating(5/5). Noise cancellation: okay but not great as expected for the price....

Sound is loud. 3. Noise cancellation is fine at this price. 4. The wire doens't get tangled. 5.

The mic is not up to the mark, if u keep mic away from ur mouth, the voice wont go in. 2. The L shaped jack can be problem for some people. 3. No one ever told this problem, i have used it for 2 years that's why i m telling.....

Reviewed in India on 21 April 2019,Mohit,Pros and Cons,"Alright so I bought these earphones at ₹550 in a deal. Let me divide it into pros and cons for you to decide if the product is right for you.. Pros:-. 1) These earphones emphasizes on “bass” so bass is good at this price range.. 2) Earphones are tangle free.. 3) They come with extra ear buds.. 4) You won’t need to increase the volume since on my iPhone I have to keep the volume less than 50% and still it sounds decently loud.. 5) It has an L shaped headphone jack so you it won’t come out easily.. Cons:-. 1) The earpiece are quite heavy I.e they tend to fall out of your ear. 2) The inlet provided with earphones can cause a bit of pain after removing it. However, you won’t feel it while wearing them.. 3) The build quality could be better.. So, to sum it all up. These bass heads provide a very good bass at this price range and if you are someone who loves bass more than vocals then it’s the right choice for you. I found that the bass is overpowering the mids and highs of music and I needed to adjust the equalizer settings on my phone. I would recommend sennheiser cx180 if you are looking for earphones under ₹1000 but they don’t have a mic so there is a downside to everything.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Could it be the weight of the metal band? I don't know. I now clip the ear phone onto my shirt (so as to not let it hang) which I think solves the problem. I tried changing the buds (or whatever it is called), it did not work. Overall, I am a fan.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Well,for me there has been no such problem as i replaced the mid size buds with the smaller ones.One problem i felt with these earphones are that they are a bit heavy. The metal finish is very good looking to your eyes but it foes cause some problem if worn for a long duration. I had to take out the earphones time to time because i felt they kind of cause a little strain on your ears.But this is only if you use it for a long duration in one go (like 4-5 hours). The sound quality is excellent. These earphones are so loud, I didn't even need to raise the volume more than 60-70%. The bass is excellent. Being a bass lover,i have no problems with these earphones. The wire is flat wire which is tangle-free and the 3.5mm jack is L-shaped which makes it a lot convinient to use. I have only used these earphones for two weeks so i cannot say much about it's durability and all but I'll update after using it for 6 months or so..

They're too heavy to stay inside your ear. Tried different buds and also tried the clip and still the earphones just drop out of your ears. I understand it is not during workout but they won't even stay in your ears even when you sitdown. We constantly have to adjust them which is annoying and cannot enjoy the music.

Sound quality is just mind blowing.. 2. Bass is the keypoint. Absolutely great bass.. 3. Treble works superb.. 4.mids and lows are well calibrated.. 5. Cable is tangle free so u won't get annoyed of it.. 6. Its very loud but doesn't get distorted. Well balanced.. Cons-. Dint came across any such thing.. Don't know How Long will it survive. Hoping for the best. Most importantly what I felt that at first you might feel disappointed with the sound quality as its loud but not clear due to over powering bass but here's the catch as soon as u get the earphone first just set the equaliser according your sound preference and then u ll actually see the charm. It will just blow your mind if u use the equaliser properly. So before listening to any song first set an equaliser and trust me you will never expect so good sound quality at this price level. It's just amazing at this price point. Definitely buy this without even thinking anything it won't disappoint you.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 3 November 2018,Avinash Kumar,Long term review of Boat Bassheads 225,"Alright so writing this after using it for more than a year, it stopped working 2 months ago the right earpod started malfunctioning and was dead the other day, anyway coming to the review. Build quality: Really good, flat wire doesn't let the earphone get tangled and the mic was placed just in the place next to the mouth just where it should be and the 3.5mm jack, it's gold plated and L-shaped if people prefer that.. Earpod quality: Pretty good, but made of metal and heavy af that's why people complain about the pod getting out from the ear which wasn't an issue for me as I found the earbuds which perfectly fit my ear canals and then it wasn't that big of an issue for me.. Sound quality: Well, as the name suggests, it's bassy like yeah really bassy but upto the point that It starts giving a headache if listening to longer periods of time because of the empowering bass, the lows were really muddy and mids were muddy but not like lows highs were kinda okayish but was good when you watch movies with it and one more thing even after fitting into ears, the noise cancellation was poor and sound leak was so much to the point that people sitting far away from me could tell which song I was listening to so that was kinda bad well, for me anyway.. Verdict: Overall 3.5 stars. Should you buy: Well, it depends on your preference really if you like really high bass then you could go for it but if you need a balanced soundstage then you're better off with something like 1More Pistons or Soundmagic ES18S.",3.0 out of 5 stars

The driver chambers of these earphones are made out of metal, which is a surprise considering the low price. They have a knurled pattern on them for better grip, and they do get cold in an air-conditioned room.. Boat generously supplies six pairs of ear tips, a clip, and a pair of ear hooks with these earphones. I think that the ear hooks are a very good addition at this price and will be helpful for people planning to work out while using these earphones. I tried using the ear hooks and found them to be comfortable.. The Y-splitter on the cable also has a metal casing, which seems to be purely for aesthetics. The gold-plated 3.5mm headphone jack has an L-shaped plug so it does not stick out much when you plug it into a device.. Boat has opted for 10mm audio drivers that have a frequency range of 20Hz - 20KHz. These earphones have an impedance of 16 Ohms and do not need a lot of power to drive them..

Reviewed in India on 14 November 2018,Srivats,Good improvement in Bass and durability compared to previous model.,"I bought the older version of Boat BassHeads 225 in Amazon almost 19 months ago. It worked perfectly fine without a single issue till last week. Beacuse, unfortunately one of the earbud (with inline mic) stopped working along with the mic too! One cannot expect to last this earphones for such a long period of 19 months for such a low price compared to other high end earphones. Thanks to it's good but not great durability. I am saying this because the L shaped audio jack and the rubber price that connects the flat cable to the aluminium body of the earbuds weared out. But other than this issue, was pretty much happy with it's performance.. This time I decided to buy the same earphones because it had upgraded the design in the areas where I found the issues in the older one. And I expected the same audio profile from the new one too. But damn!!! I was wrong.. Boat has done a really good job in tweaking the bass in the new version. You can easily identify the difference in the bass when compared to the older model. You won't find it too overwhelming and it has got the perfectly balanced bass at this price budget. The higs are also pretty decent and nice to hear.. But one cone which it retained was that it's mids is not improved like the bass. The vocals are little bit muddy amdt unclear when the song which you are playing has chorus. So, if you are a serious music lover and looking for more vocal clarity , spend some extra bucks to get earphones with more vocals clarity or good mids.. P.S:. The reason why I decided to stick with these earphones is that I mainly use them to watch videos, play games and listen to songs sometimes when bored. I am musician too but I actually LOVE the audio profile in this earphones But if you are a serious audio profile freak, this isn't not the piece for you. But it won't disappoint you at the same time. Happy shopping!",4.0 out of 5 stars

It Is also close to impossible to use just one earbud at a time, so if you want to share with a friend or for any reason want to keep only one on your ear, you'll have to keep it in with your hand, because it tends to fall easily due to the weight. If you want to use it in moving vehicles you may have to keep readjusting to make sure it does not fall off..
