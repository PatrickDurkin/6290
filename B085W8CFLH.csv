It give me hard days to reach to the customer support. Finally I got in touch with the customer support team. They don't have any service center and you need to ship the product to their warehouse. I did ship which costed me INR 160/-. Then it took multiple followups and 3 weeks to get the replacement. The customer support team also informed now it won't get replaced. That means, if the product stops working now (even in the warranty period) I need to throw it in dustbin since no replacement is going to take place. At the end, the product costed me total 760 (600 for product and 160 for shipping). And if in case I need to get it repaired, I may need to do further expense of 160 again to ship. So at the end, you are not getting the product at 600 but more that that. Better to invest in good brand and purchase better headphone then keep wasting money.. -------.

Reviewed in India on 27 February 2021,Rajneesh Malik,Too Early too less features,"This product is very good in respect of Audio Input(speakers) and Output (Mic). With volume + and - buttons in the Headset, you can increase the volume beyond the capacity of the phone, which is Great! The Bass and Treble are unbelievable!. That being said, products like these (with wireless/Bluetooth) technology have a very big flaw in general. The Headsets capability of Auto-connecting to multiple devices is an ""Evil"" in disguise of a blessing. These devices randomly connect to other devices (or keep on trying to, that have Bluetooth in ON/Broadcast state) and create interference with the ""Your"" device and hence there is an issue with frequent disconnections and they randomly disconnect from the Original device they are supposed to remain connected with.. I have experienced this with my own pTRON Tangent lite Headset that I purchased recently, but had to return it back.. My house is amidst two Samsung Smart TVs & one Smartphone (next door neighbors) and the headset keeps on disconnecting from my Smartphone and constantly remains in search of other devices.. Furthermore, there is no way you can restrict your headset, forget restricting, you cannot even disable discovery mode or stop it from further searching; resulting to which you have to Re-connect it to Your device every time it is required to perform its role with YOUR devices - (and who would ask our neighbours to switch off their Bluetooth?!). In the context of Call Receiving, you will always find the call landing on your Phone instead of the Headset and you have to reach up to the phone to reconnect it - making this device useless.. There are no issues till the time you are talking or listening to music, but the moment you stop, it will disconnect!. The worse part is that it will show the status on the phone as Connected, except that there is no Voice (or sound or music) transfer.. I have read that Headsets at higher price end also have this disability but very less.. Bluetooth Headsets are a new concept (with almost all latest devices having Bluetooth) and thus the Headsets require little bit more configurational options in future.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 5 March 2021,Deb,It is only ok for simplest of applications,"I purchased this headset at a very good price of 499. I needed a BT headset for my official skype meetings and this looked like a good low cost option to me.. After going through 2 iterations of this product (1st was replaced) I am constrained to say it is better to avoid this unless of course your requirements are only limited to taking phone calls on the mobile.. Positives first.... * Is very cost effective. * Comes ready to use, right off the bat; no hassles pairing, pre-charged. * Very thoughtfully provides you an additional pair of those silicon/rubber ear muffs (whatever they are called) for the buds. So what's wrong? Pretty much everything else. Here's my take.... * Has 0 bass and sometimes sounds pretty tiny/hollow. * Has inconsistent quality. The first set will not work properly (wont carry my voice on a call) whether paired to a laptop or a phone. Had to return for a replacement. * Second one could pair and work with the phone. However quality of sound was debatable. Definitely not for listening to music. * Biggest challenge was with my laptop and skype calls. This was the whole reason for buying this device. My tech support team spent much time to figure out the issue. While it paired with the laptop initially the mic will not work at all. Later they figured out the sound coming through the mic was so low that the laptop was not detecting the input and switching over to the laptop mic. So even after they forced the laptop to only use only headset mic the person at the other end just could not hear almost anything! It was almost as if the mic was covered by something!. Net bottomline... This headset is of barely any use unless you need a headset on a low budget and your only expectation is to make phone calls. Otherwise just AVOID!!!. Footnote: I wonder what those 37% people who gave it 5 star rating were really smoking! Or was theire expectation so low that a mere pairing of the headset with their phone made them so gleeful... will never know!",2.0 out of 5 stars
