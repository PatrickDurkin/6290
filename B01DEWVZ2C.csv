Reviewed in India on 30 October 2018,Sameer Patil,boAt 225 vs JBL CS100 vs Sennheisers cx180 | DETAILED Comparison after 1 YEAR of USE.,"NOTE:. @ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.. @ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.. @ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.. I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,. BUILT QUALITY :. ------------------. ‚óè boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.. ‚óè JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.. Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.. ‚óè Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.. ‚óè‚óè WINNER- boAt 225 ‚óè‚óè. COMFORT :. ------------. ‚óè boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.. ‚óè JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.. ‚óè Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.. ‚óè‚óè WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óè. LOUDNESS :. -------------. CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI. ‚óè boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.. ‚óè JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.. ‚óè Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.. ‚óè‚óè WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óè. SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :. ---------------------------------------------. I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.. ‚óè boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.. ‚óè JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.. ‚óè Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.. ‚óè‚óè WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ‚óè‚óè. SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :. ----------------------------------. ‚óè boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.. ‚óè JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.. ‚óè Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P. NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.. ‚óè‚óè WINNER - boAt 225 ‚óè‚óè. CUSTOMER CARE :. --------------------. ‚óè boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.. ‚óè JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.. ‚óè Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.. NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.. ‚óè‚óè WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ‚óè‚óè. CONNECTIVITY :. ------------------. All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.. VERDICT :. ----------. I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.. Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 23 December 2018,Karan Gill,"Reliable, durable, budget friendly & simply amazing!","I am writing this review after about 6 months of use as most earphones i purchased under Rs 1000/- never lasted for even half a year.. Surprisingly these are still working well (*touchwood*) despite my rugged use.. Pros:. - Great external noise cancelation.. - Good clarity while watching movies. - Reasonably decent bass levels of the price. They wont let you down when the beat drops :P. - Being an Audiophile whose working for brands like Yamaha, Jamo Dynaudio, mission amd many more these are the best for music to hear ever subtle note however I have to keep in my that I paid 599 for these on a lightning deal which makes the superb value for money while listening to music.. - Gold plated connector pin for higher conductivity.. - Clear microphone quality over call or while recording a vlog.. - lightweight due to which they are not a burden on your ears and don't fall of your ears easily.. - Cable spread adjustable lock built-in.. Cons:. - Gold plating on connector pin is slightly wearing of after 6 months.. - There are better bass heavy earphones at this or lower price point. But this is very subjective to the genre of music you listen too. As to much bass kills the Mids & Highs. So you can call these headphones as balanced.. Conclusion:. Go for these if you're looking for a pair of branded earphone under 999/- with a microphone which will last you for a reasonable long time & have good quality balanced sound for movies and music..

Before these I purchased Sennheiser cx 180 street 2 but in just 3 months the sound quality dropped to minimum. Had to switch back to JBL.. So here's the detailed review.... Pros :. 1. Sound : Too great. Had to put my sound bar to half. Quality doesn't lessens even at the max sound. Bass is superb too.. 2. Built quality : marvelous built. One thing I like about JBL is that they make slight changes even if the launched model is way old. Built quality has been upgraded. Only thing I wanted was L shaped lead but it's fine.. 3. Noise cancellation : great noise cancellation. You can totally rely on this. Once you put on everything will seem great about it.. 4. Ear comfort : fits too well. You won't need to adjust them once you've put them on.. Cons : apart from the normal shaped lead I didn't found any cons about it. It will last for more than an year and can even work for more than 2 years if handled carefully.. Hope this will help you decide.. Have a nice day!!,5.0 out of 5 stars

Realme cable are braided nylon cord whereas JBL use normal rubber material cable. Though both are tangle free, but Realme is better in terms of cable quality and to manage it's cable than JBL.. Now comparing sound quality, I found JBL far better than Realme. Many YouTube blogger said that Realme sound is best in ‚Çπ600 -700 price range earphone segment because of it's 11mm driver. They gave better position to Realme than JBL. Though Realme has 11mm driver, but it's sound is noisy. JBL sound quality is smoother than Realme.

So you don't need to hold it to your mouth while calling. Also their is a button on mic whivh can be used to control music and receive/end the calls.. 4. Good Loudness.. Now the cons for which i have given them three stars-. 1. Treble is really high. And you can't listen them to full volume.. 2. In some songs these gets very harsh u can't listen these even at 80% volume.. 3. Not recommended for longer listening beacuse of harsh sound and also as these goes deep in your ears, so you will pain after some time.. 4. Build quality is not that great.. 5. No volume control given on these only one button.. Conclusion:-. I think these are ok earphones considering the price. These have good bass.. If you increase your budget little bit you can buy one more piston fit earphones which have better sound quality and treble and bass is balanced but little less bass.

Noise cancellation is just mind blowing. Even if you just put them on and not play anything also, you can't hear people talking around you. But if it's at full volume, even if battles are going on around you, you can't hear them(a little exaggeration, haha) If you are an extreme basshead, please go for boAt. The bass in this earphones is basically non existent, but hey, you don't buy JBL for the bass, but for the pure sound(which is wonderful, by the way) Even if you are a person who likes the Apple model of earphones, and not the shove in the ear type(like me), you won't find any problem with the comfort, thanks to the angled design. Finally, definitely buy this product, but wait until the price becomes 549 Indian rupees(about 7.45 US Dollars, 6.09 Euros) , because Amazon sometimes makes it 700 Indian Rupees(9.5 US Dollars, 7.78 Euros).

And so it‚Äôs the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!. Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!!. So I will put an update as soon as I‚Äôm done solving my issue!!!!!. FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/-. THEN!!!!!. AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT‚ÄôS A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!!. BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :). AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.. SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.in. AS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!. Thanks to all of you who read and understand my review.. And finally please do comment if you want to do so and if you find this review helpful please hit or click that ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù.",3.0 out of 5 stars

First of all thnx to amazon for always timely delivery.. Moving towards the product - a simple, brief and clear review :. JBL - a brand name when it comes to music lovers. A brand where competetion meets its arrogance. JBL C100SI earphones comes here when its comes for the amazing crystal breaking clear sound like each crack can be purely experienced. A decent priced earphone but dont knw why JBL didnt implement the bass experience in it.. Sound as discussed it really very amazing, pure, stereo dimensions can purely be experienced on connecting to a 3D source.. What i dont like in it is THE VERY HIGH TREBLE AND VERY LOW BASS. THE MAX VOLUME IS JUST AVERAGE, AMD MINIMUM IS TOO TOO TOO MUCH LOW TO BE HEARD. You need to connect to a third equilizer source for enhancing bass.. Design is pretty much decent but not so classy as compared to its price range. Again JBL does its best in engravimg its brand name in every part of the earphones.. The bend type eardrums should be slightly more bended in order to be perfectly supportive to the cheeks and the ear area.. Dont knw why none of here in these reviews hav mentioned its recording quality. Guys this is the segment where JBL C100SI meets the target. I keep recording songs with karaoke and really thumbs up to JBL for its mic. The stereo recording quality is really very much impressive. I am a fond of singing and spend most times in starmaker app. These earphone really gives an amazing record over other earphones. I have tried MDR series, skullcandy, Boat but mic quality was not decent upto their price segment... Overall rating : 8/10. Overall the earphone is good for music lovers who love slow songs where bass is not a matter.. But in this price segment its good..",4.0 out of 5 stars

The bass is reasonable, well it's not the best out there, but good for long listening time.. Noice cancellation is good(not the best out there ), since it is a secure fit inside your ear, even then u can be aware of your surroundings.. The length of the chord is perfect.. There is a mic, which is loud and clear while phone call sessions.. There is a switch right next to the mic, which trigger 'attend call' when the phone rings, 'end call' to finish the call. Pressing and holding will trigger google assistant. While listening music, one press-play/pause, double press for next song, triple press for previous song..

Starting with the build quality this is having just ok kind of build quality. Wire quality after the split is so much cheap and thin. SOUND QUALITY. When it comes to sound I would divide this review into three parts. 1. LOWER FREQUENCIES. lower sounds or bass is not highly emphasized when the bass is required it just comes and it goes. These are not recommended for heavy bass heads. 2.MID TONES. when it comes to mid-tones they are produced very well on this one especially vocals are emphasized singers voice is pretty good on this one. 3.HIGH TONES. when it comes to high tones I would say JBL did a miracle here you would definitely hear a lot about tunes from guitar, violin and other instruments. The sound stage is also excellent. VERDICT. coming to verdict I would say these sound incredible for what you are paying. These JBL c100si impressed me a lot in terms of sound quality. I would suggest not to buy the JBL c200 si because they are just rebranded version of these at a higher price. If you want a pair of earphones especially for bass go with real me buds 2 or Sennheiser cx180 street 2. If you want to listen pure melodious kind of music trust me these are the best you can get .. you could even use an equalizer by chance if you want to increase the bass.
