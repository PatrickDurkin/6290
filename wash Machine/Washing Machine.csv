B089WZZ33C,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2020,Sarang T.,Tailor-made For my house!,"More than anything, the compact dimensions with a 7 kg capacity was the thing why I chose this machine. As you can see from where I've placed it, space was the main driving factor for me and I can say this one proved to be tailor-made for my house. Coming to the operation, it's been hassle-free till now and functions silently without any fuss, precisely what you expect from a washing machine so I have to say I'm happy! Full marks to the design and ease of use!",5.0 out of 5 stars

B089WZZ33C,Reviewed in India on 3 November 2020,Keegs,Super Washing Machine,One of the reasons I purchased this washing machine was because of the dimensions. My building staircase is narrow. The washing machine is sleek and super silent. It does not have a soak function. Washing of clothes is above par and gives really clean clothes post wash. Perfect for a family of 4. I'm using this washing machine for less than a month. Got it during the Amazon Sale.,5.0 out of 5 stars
B089WZZ33C,Reviewed in India on 5 February 2021,Sumit pathak,okay.,"so , i ordered thai product after seeing the description that says it has air dry and eco wash so i ordered the product right way but my expectations got shattered when the Panasonic installation guy told me that thia machine is not what i have purchased and lack features that i want . so i called up Amazon immediately and guy talked to them as well and told d issue . so i asked him to pack the stuff as it was delivered and kept it intact so that i can get a new one as a replacement .. Amazon asked me to get a job sheet from that guy which he refused right way stating that he has not provided any demo so he cant give me job sheet . After a long call sessions with amazon and Panasonic for close to a week .I lost my cool and asked to them to get it replaced asap .. After which Amazon took this iaaue on priority basis and my amt was refunded same day ... i give a thumbs up to amazon for solving this issue .. and thumbs down for misleading advertising on website as after confirming Panasonic they stated that this model dont have any airdry or eco wash .. so pls beware if u are ordering anything which is mismatched from what is mentioned on site .. and get it returned .. DON'T SETTLE FIR LESS ...",3.0 out of 5 stars
B089WZZ33C,Reviewed in India on 17 March 2021,Kpankaj,"Excellent, Compact Machine","As another reviewer pointed out, this is probably the most compact 7kg top-loader automatic available, which was the primary reason why we bought this. The bonus: it turned out to be a great machine as well; looks good, great build quality, low noise, and does the job efficiently. Also, the installation was done virtually an hour after delivery, so full marks for that!. I guess most machines in this range are pretty much the same in terms of features; the only differentiators will be longevity, and the quality of the after sales service. Time will tell on these points...",5.0 out of 5 stars
B089WZZ33C,Reviewed in India on 18 October 2020,Amit Sharma,Superb compact machine for small families.,"This machine is perfect for small families. For us with 4 members,we need to run it once in two days. Has the basic functions of wash and dry. Howsoever,it would have been better if the manufacturer could have provided a soak function as well. This would certainly have been a welcome move without adding any technological complication for the manufacturer.. Cons:. If you accidentally select a mode and start washing the clothes option, then the machine will completed cycle and then only stop. Perhaps should be user intervention to stop it or to reset it. Apart from this I am totally satisfied with the product, cloudtail India delivered the product in pristine condition. It was a very good deal at 15k.",5.0 out of 5 stars
B089WZZ33C,Reviewed in India on 24 February 2021,Soma Roy,Clothes get tangled every time for every wash. Too much lint on woollens after wash.,"Buttons not so easy or user friendly. Everytime you need to choose the type of wash you want. Difficult to use for aged people with poor eyesight. There is no Bydefault setting, like just press power button and start for regular wash.. Too much lint on clothes specially woollens. Every time I have to clean the lint trap before a laundry.. Machine wobbles quite a bit during drying cycle.. The water out pipe is on the right but our house setting needs it to be on the left of the machine. Our technician could not fix the water outlet pipe on the left side. He said it can not be done.. The only good thing is the soft close lid and auto start feature.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Previously i had LG which is very easy to operate and 7kg mentioned but the tub room seems lesser than my 7kg LG washing machine.. When i start rinse option it initially spins, i dont know why. Because i filled half tub water and selected rinse, but it drains that half tub of water before rinsing.. Many such minor issues in it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

B085JF9J44,Reviewed in India on 19 September 2020,Consumer,Worth the money. But the build quality??,Best in its price range. Functioning is smooth and I am using it since couple of months now I guess. And it's good looking compared to some other machines in this price range.. The negative is its build quality which is not the worst. But it's cheap plastic or atleast it's not strong enough to last some years.. Another point is nowhere I could find the energy rating in my machine. But it is mentioned 5 stars in the website.,3.0 out of 5 stars
B085JF9J44,Reviewed in India on 4 February 2021,kiran,Cool Thing about the top load washing machine which  I purchased.,"I am software Engineer.. I need to relocate to local town in A.P with minimum luggage due to pandemic. Here comes the problem. I was looking for low budget washing machine as I have Front load washing machine at Hyderabad.. I searched for Top load washing machine which can be used for 6 months with out any issues. With the customer feed back in the Amazon website, I have purchased White Westinghouse (Trademark By Electrolux) 8 kg Semi-Automatic Top Loading Washing Machine.. From My perspective.. 9th day today ( I purchased it on 25th Jan 2021).. it is the best in the Budget.. I feel like families me (Four members & not hard working :-)) it is the best. As of now.. I can give 5 stars to this.. I did not thought Top load machines will remove dirt. My wife observed only oil stain was not removed on jute bag. Thats okay. Maintenance.. is less.. 1. Plug and Play ( no need of installation). 2. Spinner removes the water and almost dries them out .. I could say 90% water removal. 3. No need to stand 4. You can lift it and place it any where you want. From my end, I could see little manual work is needed when compared to top load washing machine. I say that is okay for me as maintenance will be more in front load washing machine. Lets hope for the best and I assume machine will not give troubles in the future .. I mean atleast for next 6 months. Company provides 2 year warranty on the machine.",5.0 out of 5 stars

B07WSQDMHJ,Reviewed in India on 2 March 2021,Amazon Customer,Its little costly but worth it,Compare to other washing machine. This seems to be little costly which is around 13450 but worth it. If you are cost conscious than go for other brand. But if you wanted to invest in long term with 5 star energy efficient than go for this.. Couple of points which helped me and may be useful for you too (2 month after purchased).. Pros :. - Check energy efficient rating. (This machine has 5 star rating). - Machine is easily movable or not (This washing has 2 front 360 wheel and other are normal). - Round Lint which I liked . I don't have exact answer is it really good or not. Find it ok.. - The built looks good and clean. The material is plastic but looks good. LG always has some plus point in this area whichever product of them you go for.. - The motor RPM speed is good (1350). Noise as usual is same as other semi automatic washing machine.. - Rat away material which promise Rat will not built their housing inside your washing machine.. You will find most of the washing machine in the range of 11k to 12k have the above features . I checked the review on Flipkart as well as Amazon. Find too much fluctuation on other brand pricing but the price of this washing was constant as well as review were mostly par @ average 4.5 (above 100 to 200 reviews).,5.0 out of 5 stars

I bought this product from Amazon on July 2018 at rupees 12900. Definitely it's a very good deal and the best thing about the timely delivery of product by Amazon. Actually I am not using washing machine but my mother use this and she really comfortable with the machine functions and it's performance.. The function of the Machines are really friendly and anyone use them without any proper manual or guidelines.. the build quality of washing machine is really good the material that LG used is very durable. We are a very old and happy customer of LG products and I know that LG have such a fabulous customer products in Indian market so when we are talking about home appliances just go for it guys..

B07H2W3J46,Reviewed in India on 10 November 2020,Tenzin Choekyab,Honest Review After A Month‚Äôs Use,"I purchased it during amazon sale last month in October 2020. Got it for 13,700‚Çπ after discount. Very easy to use, doesn‚Äôt makes that much noise like other brands, it also dries up clothes & washing level is also awesome. After so much reviews & price tag from other brands, I found Bosch the best. + I got 2 years warranty which is a bonus point. For a family of 3-5, it‚Äôs the best choice. Engineer called me before da product was delivered & I asked him to come once product will be delivered & he came on the same day. I found white color the best & beautiful. Overall, it‚Äôs an amazing machine that one will definitely like it...üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",5.0 out of 5 stars
B07H2W3J46,Reviewed in India on 6 October 2019,sudheery,"Buy it if you don't have to talk to their customer ""support""","Their customer care sucks big time. I purchased it from a local dealer and had a question whether the model has a drain pump or not. As a cost cutting measure they have ONE manual for all the 10000 models they have and it is not clear whether a particular model has a feature or not (very dangerous if the installation depends on the model - whether the model has drain pump built in or not).. Called their customer care - that lady wants to send a technician to my home and charge me, all I need is a small information and she put the phone down saying ""we don't provide information"" - in a rude tone. Clueless and customer unfriendly",1.0 out of 5 stars

B07H2W3J46,Reviewed in India on 5 February 2021,A Dutta,Don't buy.,The main problem of this machine is can't select the appropriate wash programme & water level automatically according to weight of garments. The service technician told me that the sensor of this machine is not so good to sence weight of garments.. Now I'm selecting wash programme & water level manually.. This not desired from a automatic washing machine. Previously I had an LG washing machine and it could automatically select the appropriate wash program and water level.,1.0 out of 5 stars
