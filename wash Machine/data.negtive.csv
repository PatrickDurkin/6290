"so , i ordered thai product after seeing the description that says it has air dry and eco wash so i ordered the product right way but my expectations got shattered when the Panasonic installation guy told me that thia machine is not what i have purchased and lack features that i want . so i called up Amazon immediately and guy talked to them as well and told d issue . so i asked him to pack the stuff as it was delivered and kept it intact so that i can get a new one as a replacement .. Amazon asked me to get a job sheet from that guy which he refused right way stating that he has not provided any demo so he cant give me job sheet . After a long call sessions with amazon and Panasonic for close to a week .I lost my cool and asked to them to get it replaced asap .. After which Amazon took this iaaue on priority basis and my amt was refunded same day ... i give a thumbs up to amazon for solving this issue .. and thumbs down for misleading advertising on website as after confirming Panasonic they stated that this model dont have any airdry or eco wash .. so pls beware if u are ordering anything which is mismatched from what is mentioned on site .. and get it returned .. DON'T SETTLE FIR LESS ...","negtive",0,0.146999185233386,0,0,0,0,0.0307570075238651,0.0339942403755143,0,0.0383284084752486,0.0383284084752486,0,0.153313633900994,0.0766568169504972,0,0.0281721270131956,0,0,0.0152483861473812,0.0339942403755143,0,0,0.0383284084752486,0.0322741950367429,0,0,0.0280413522277992,0.0270513155660183,0,0,0.0645483900734859,0.0359798869945898,0,0,0,0,0.0422639701905647,0,0
"Buttons not so easy or user friendly. Everytime you need to choose the type of wash you want. Difficult to use for aged people with poor eyesight.
