Reviewed in India on 11 September 2017,Polash Majumdar,One of the best value for money,"This is a splendid product. Very to-the-point approach from the manufacturing perspective. One of the best price-to-performance ratio.. Pros:. 1. Freesync is supported. This means if you are using an AMD graphics card, your refresh rate automatically shoots beyond the 60Hz limit.. 2. Reader/Custom modes are available. As a user who uses the PC for gaming along with web browsing, movie watching, programming, a reader mode is very much required. Prolonged exposure to vibrant and bright colors are not always the best fit for programming. This monitor takes care of that.. 3. Comes with a decent HDMI male-to-male connector. The cable quality might not be world-class but does a decent job of responsive video data transfer, when it comes to quick display changes (like gaming).. 4. Minimal bezel at the edges.. 5. Beautiful and faithful color representations.. Cons:. 1. No horizontal swivel. This is a minor nice-to-have feature. However, the monitor does have adjustable vertical swiveling, which makes up for the missing feature.. 2. The main monitor control button (at the bottom base) is a little cumbersome to handle. This could have been better designed.. Two things to take note of:. A. If Freesync is turned on, you might have difficulties getting into BIOS as many motherboards do not support displays beyond 60Hz. It's kinda stupid but worth knowing. B. For the programmers: This is a normal DPI monitor (meaning the Dots-Per-Inch is 96 and so, it does not fall into the high-DPI category). This is just an information. This does not mean that the monitor is good or bad. Just that it is a normal DPI monitor.. All in all, a great monitor.

IPS panel is very helpful to the editors or graphics designers or gamers. Also this monitor has black stabilizer by which you can easily enjoy the dark scenes on screen. LG is a leading led tv maker company with OLED screen, so it is as expected that it have to be a great panel. The control of the monitor's can be changed either from the utility on screen display software provided in the cd or by the joystick monitor button moving and clicking right left up and down. However the other company's monitor is not so good or balanced cause either they have panel with corner light bleed or faded color grade or less port while this monitor has balanced features with perfect black which makes this monitor great and popular.

It was working but the quality was so much disappointing after 3 days the colour of screen become more pink , so I adjusted it by reducing the red colour in rgb but still it was not a good experience. The Amazon services suck. I really wanted a refund I don't got it. Tip: for buying monitor. Don't get lured to free sync monitor if it's only 60hz monitor. For gaming look for High hz rate monitor instead of type of panel. Usually go for the tn panel it's cheaper and have high frame rate and more fps. For gaming fps is more important than viewing angle, color and contrast. 60hz monitor are not suitable for high end games go for a 120 or 144hz but don't buy that if you don't have a proper graphic card. Buy a ips panel only if you are going to watch too many videos but not for gaming unless you have a really enormous budget.

Reviewed in India on 12 July 2017,I.G,BEST BUDGET GAMING MONITOR OF THE WORLD,"INTRODUCTION :. :::::::::::::::::::::::::. If you are looking for a great monitor, your search has ended. Without a doubt, it is the best budget gaming monitor . It is also the best monitor for video editing, movie watching and Internet browsing under 10,000 Rupees. And I will also try to explain, why it is better than its competitors, the Dell S2216H and HP 22ES, which are also awesome monitors under 10,000.. WHY THIS MONITOR IS INTERESTING :. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. Under the budget of 10,000,. a) It is among the very few monitors which are :. * 1) 21.5 inch (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, Benq RL2240HE, Samsung LS22E310HY/XL, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),. * 2) Full HD(Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),. * 3) IPS (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES,LG 22MP58VQ),. * 4) Matte screen with IPS panel (LG 22MP58VQ and Samsung LS19F350HNWXXL(Glossy with PLS panel) ) (others have either glossy screen with IPS panel or matte screen with VA or TN panel). b) And is the only one which has :. * 1) Free-sync technology,. * 2) 75 Hz refresh rate(All other have 60 HZ). Please write in comments, if I am missing any monitor in the above list, so that others can read it.. ABOUT BRAND :. :::::::::::::::::::::::::. LG makes some awesome products and they keeps providing cutting edge technology in its monitors. No wonder, we see them so much on youtube and other websites.. BASIC INFORMATION :. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. I will try to explain what these terms mean in brackets after the specifications.. * Size 55.88cm (22). * Panel Type IPS (Best panel type for color reproduction). * Color Gamut (CIE1976) 72% (Color gamut refers to the various levels of colors that can potentially be displayed by a device.). * sRGB Coverage 86.1% (This is most common color gamut. Other are Adobe RGB and Photoshop RGB). * Color Depth (Num of Colors) 16.7M colors (Most common color depth. 10 and 12 bit color depth is for serious graphic designers). * Pixel Pitch (mm) 0.2915*0.2915 (Distance between centre of pixels to other centre of pixel. Lower the distance, sharper the image ). * Resolution 1920 x 1080. * Brightness(Typ.) 250cd/m2 (It's ok. Many other monitors offer the same brightness). * Contrast Ratio(Original) 1000:1 (Here VA panels are better, which offer better contrast ratios of 3000:1 like Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM. Better contrast ratio means deeper blacks. But for IPS 1000:1 contrast ratio is common.). * (DFC) Mega (LG's DFC is a meaningless number. Dynamic contrast means nothing, it's marketing jargon.). * (GTG) 5ms (Its not great, but its good for gaming. For awesome 1 ms response time look at TN panels like Benq RL2240HE). * Viewing Angle(CR‚â•10) 178/178 (One of the strong points of IPS panels is great viewing angles. No color distortion even if you look from very side). * Surface Treatment Anti-Glare,3H (Matte screen is a must have, if you have lot of light in your room). * Display interfaces D-Sub(VGA), DVI-D, HDMI (Many others have only two of these three display interfaces). * Audio output Headphone Out (Audio quality was not good, and why would anyone connect headphones to monitors instead of their PCs). * Maximum Power Consumption 17.6W. * Sleep Mode Power consumption Under 0.3W. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION :. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. * Also comes with cable holder, which is a detachable plastic part, that comes separately with the monitor and attaches itself to back of stand, and manages cables, so that you cannot see cables from front. It keeps things neat and managed.. * It is VESA mount compatible. Many budget monitors are not VESA mount compatible.. * Comes pre caliberated. Not many do. You get a printed 'color calibration factory report' with monitor inside box. You don't need to adjust anything by going into menu, if you don't want.. * Not all IPS are good but this really is and shows a lot better image than TN panels.. * You see sharper image on 22 inch 1080p screen, than 24 or 27 inch 1080p screen. As all three screens have same number of pixels, smaller size will have more pixel per inch than bigger screens.. BONUS INFORMATION :. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::. I am really enjoying this monitor. If you like to have lots of features at low price and still want good quality product, this monitor is for you. Honestly I am waiting to see which monitor will come to dethrone this one, as the best budget monitor. I mean which monitor will be able to add more features than this one without increasing the price and still maintaining the quality.. I have many stories to tell, about my experience with this monitor. How I connected this with different PCs and laptops and how it interacted differently on them. Not going to bore you guys with details but a word of advice try to use this monitor over HDMI, as it works better and adds feature instead of VGA.. You also get OnScreen Control Software with this monitor, which I liked. Its simple to use. You don't have to control monitor settings from menu by using the joystick but you can do it from this monitor using your mouse easily. It lets you add display presets to different applications. And the presets will change automatically, when you switch to different applications. For example; if I add Reader preset to Microsoft Word and Cinema preset to VLC player, the brightness and contrast will go down whenever I switch to Word and will go up, whenever I switch to VLC.. You can also use screen split feature with one click from it. Screen splitting is that you can split your screen and look at two, three or four windows at a time on your screen. For example; I can look at chrome and word, side by side and I will not have to switch between them again and again, if I am doing work which needs both of these applications. Although, Windows 10 and some other free softwares like WinSplit and GridVista,offer split screen feature, but I liked this software. It's easy.. Also the main thing. It really shows sharp image quality. Color and contrast are fantastic.. THE STAND OUT FEATURES OF THIS MONITOR:. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. As mentioned above, it is the only Free-sync monitor available under Rs 10,000.. In short, Free-sync technology allows the monitor's refresh rate to continuously adapt with respect to graphic card's frame rate. So, in a instance if your graphic card was generating 48 frames per second, your monitor will adapt to show 48 frames per second. All other monitors are fixed at 60 Hz or you can say that they are fixed to show 60 frames per second.. Now the question is why your monitor needs to adapt according to graphic card. Because it solves two problems which are,. 1) tearing, when frames per second generated by your graphic card are more than 60Hz(or what monitor can output). 2) stuttering, which is generated to solve the problem of tearing by using Vertial sync technology (V-sync). Watch some youtube videos to understand better about Free-sync. Without watching these videos, you will not understand tearing and stuttering. And without understand them, you will not understand the need of Free-sync.. Some basic things about Free-sync :. 1) You will need a AMD graphic card for taking benefits of Free-sync. Because Free-sync is a AMD technology. NVidea has similar technology with name G-sync. But G-sync monitors are very costly in comparison to Free-sync monitors. And I am assured that they will not be available under Rs 10,000 for a long long time.. 2) You unlock 75Hz refresh rate when you unable Free-sync.. THE PEOPLE IT WILL BENEFIT MOST :. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. Gamers (even with Nvidea graphic card, as they also get 75Hz), Video editors and designers (as colors are important for them, which they cannot get on TN and VA panels) and any casual user(who simply uses computer for using mails and watch youtube videos) will benefit from this monitor.. Laptop owners who want a bigger 22 inch and higher 1080 resolution matte screen in comparison to their mostly smaller 14 inch and lower 768 resolution glossy screen.. BEST PLACE TO BUY FROM:. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. Buy it from amazon, because many old units come with VGA cable. And here you get new manufactured units with HDMI cable. I received such a new unit that it was manufactured on 25th April in China and I was using it on 4 th June. Approximately 1 month after it was made. Quality of HDMI cable is good.. PROS :. ::::::::::. * 1) Free-sync. * 2) Anti glare IPS screen. * 3) 75 Hz refresh rate. * 4) Crisp image quality. * 4) Black stabilizers, for adjusting screen's gamma curve, which helps in seeing dark areas of games easily.. * 5) Awesome Onscreen Control Software. * 6) Best budget gaming monitor. CONS :. :::::::::::. * 1) Bezels are not as thin as many say.. * 2) Stand can only tilt, has no height adjustment or rotation. And also wobbles.. * 3) Only one HDMI.. * 4) Shows some IPS glow.. * 5) Glossy plastic back and stand.. * 6) Because of its popularity, it might not be available or sellers might increase their prices in future.. * 7) No speakers. ALTERNATIVES :. ::::::::::::::::::::::::. If you are not interested in many of the features present in this monitor you can also opt for Dell S2216H, LG 22MP58VQ and HP 22ES. Which sometimes go down in price. But HP22ES has slow response time of 14ms (GTG).. CONCLUSION :. ::::::::::::::::::::::. I didn't expected something like this will ever come under the price of 10,000. But it did. It's undoubtedly the best budget gaming monitor around the world.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Dear All, I bought this product on 06.08.2020 (prime day sale) and same was delivered on 10.08.2020.. Am Not a pure techie btw, hence skipping technical aspects of review.. many others have detailed; let's take a cue from them.. BELIEVE ME NOT GIVING IMMEDIATE REVIEWS.. Writing only after 2 months of usage.. that too after expiry of Amazon returns date... so this is genuine.. I experienced following problems.. feel many others reading this would have experienced too.. till this moment of writing this review i find there are 3.8k buyers incl. me... so !.. 1. Amazon IN says Included Components for this PC Monitor has "" Monitor, Stand, Power Cord, Connectivity Cables "" - however just received HDMI.. enquired with various stakeholders of team LG India for other cables - sorry only eerie silence received as revert despite escalation; felt no point coordinating with team LG.. If you enquire with Amazon IN, they too do not have this info, just would redirect us to LG. Even if you mention this to LG corporate marketing team, eerie silence would be received as revert.. 2. My system configuration is Pentium dual core 2.6Ghz - 64 bit Win 7 Ultimate OS; using D-Sub port for CPU and monitor connectivity. Despite having this config; also compatible with LG Onscreen control dedicated software for its PC video monitors (as per LG India portal), still Onscreen did not work.. 3. Spoke umpteen times to various stakeholders of team LG India (incl. Technical trainer and technical team troubleshooter) - sorry i was told this Video PC monitor can be used only for extended viewing say with Laptop - when probed why it was mentioned NO where in LG india (or) Amazon India portal in their product pages - the end result was i was asked to return the monitor for refunds... and a callback supposedly to be received did not happen in last 1.5 months.. 4. I challenge most would disbelieve me with this kind of brand LG service; fine with it, as I have documentary proofs. I already wrote to regulatory bodies like NCH and noted it's not worth complaining as you donot receive support despite if you share umpteen proofs and updates... Only time waste !!!.. 5. With Onscreen control absence.. am unable to use display Presets and VERY IMPORTANTLY Screen Split has not even worked in last 2 months as it is not available in physical menu. I could not even see now how screen split would be like in my present 22MP68VQ monitor despite 2 months passed.. 6. I repeatedly get a command in PC during system boot that my video monitor is not set to 1920*1028.. this is despite we set the resolution rate to 1920*1028 in system.. pc monitor never adjusts to our resolution set on systems.. sadly this 1920*1028 is not available to be set in physical menu and onscreen software is the only go !.. 7. I found a twitter user complaining about a LG TV/Monitor (made in China) product becoming defective in 2 years and was asking for replacement... As Country of Origin for this product is China - not sure how long will it sustain; though this product has 3 Year Warranty.... 8. Am from Chennai and have in the last 2 months spoken over 2 hours with various stakeholders of LG India team and have sent umpteen mails still as of date even after 2 months only miscommunications, misguidance, contradictory assistance, NO timelines and eerie silence were received as revert from LG India team.. 9. Even if you escalate to National consumer helpline, no use as LG does nothing in terms of service as one of its manager went to the extent of even suggested for returning to take refund instead of trouble shooting.. 10. LG service engineer spent 1.5 hours trouble shooting the problem on 02.09.2020 and was NOT successful despite he said OSC is an open source application which would run on all OS.. 11. The same service engineer called a week later and suggested to check with their inhouse CPU in my place, when we asked for resolution he proved a turncoat saying if it works with their cpu then my OS is an issue, reviewers could note the versions received from team LG India.. 12. We wrote to their Senior management and corporate teams with all proofs still nothing happened in past 2 months.. 13. Our complaint to NCH & MCA with umpteen proofs went in favour of LG as NCH asked us to approach NCDRC.. End result: if anyone believes brand LG being global their products and service levels would be appreciable, then think twice... I own almost almost 60k worth of various consumer appliances of LG still I had to face this obnoxious music from LG team india and its local staffs.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 23 May 2017,Don Numa,Good Design,"The design and the price is really good. I disabled freesync because I could see flickering. Had to adjust settings so that light colors weren't over bright. It would have been better if it could detect the source when I switch off my console and start my pc. There is some back light bleed in the corners which can become worse in dark scenes if I move to either sides too much which cancels out the viewing angle advantage of IPS.. I love the design. Everyone keeps asking me why I chose 22 instead of the 24 inch. I need at least 100 ppi. I guess others don't give much importance to details in games, movies and text.. I dont like buying monitors because they aren't improving. Even if I get an expensive one, there will be problems that I notice and I feel horrible. But this price is good. I wasted hours searching online trying to justify buying an expensive one. I don't know if I am missing something.

Reviewed in India on 18 May 2018,Pradeep,Good monitor but too much backlight,"I received the monitor in one day thanks to Prime delivery. Amazon packaging was fine but LG did not pack the included CD properly. The CD was kept without cover with other items and was already broken when I opened the box. However the CD is not important as LG software can be downloaded from their website so I did not consider that for rating this monitor. There is a HDMI cable included in the box. No drivers are required to use the monitor and you can simple plug it in and turn it on.. At first I didn't know how to turn the monitor on. There did not seem to be any buttons on the sides of the monitor which left me puzzled. Then I found a single hidden whitish-color button at the bottom of the monitor which is used for all the controls. It is not visible unless you turn the monitor upside down and see. This single button can be used for changing all the settings by moving the button left, right, forward or back and it works well.. The ports available are good. You have a HDMI port, DVI-D, D-SUB IN and an audio-out AUX port which is quite useful if you want to connect chromecast to the monitor to watch Netflix or Youtube. There are no inbuilt speakers so you have to connect speakers to the monitor if you are using chromecast or amazon fire stick.. The display quality and color quality of the monitor are good. The viewing angles are great. However my biggest complaint is the brightness. The default brightness is set to 100 which is way too bright. I had to set the brightness to 0(yes, zero) for it to be comfortable. Even then it is a little too bright and there is little too much backlit which makes black colours look lighter. I do not like how black is represented in this monitor. There is also slight backlight bleed on the bottom left and especially right side which is noticeable if the background is full black.. I have not experienced AMD free sync feature as I use an Nvidia GPU so I cannot comment about that but gameplay is mostly smooth. I will be getting a new AMD GPU next month so I will update my review about free sync after that.. Overall this is a great monitor with lots of good ports and features for the price if you don't mind the brightness and a little backlight bleed on the sides.. EDIT:. After changing some settings and adjusting black levels, the black color is much better now and there is not too much light.",5.0 out of 5 stars

HP 22es. it has ips matte screen but Response time 14 ms gray to gray so cant use for fast gaming. Dell S2216H. it has glossy ips screen only suitable for watching cinema from long distance. if you use it for reading news paper, graphic designing more than 1 hour cause eye stain and may cause to decrease our vision. in my past i have dell S2240L monitor which has ""Glossy with Low-Haze 3H"" screen it caused to reduce my vision.

Reviewed in India on 15 January 2018,Utkarsh Tiwari,Better than other display in the similar range but still not perfect!,"Let us start with the in-box content. It comes with a manual, a driver CD (so you can use your mouse to navigate within the display settings), HDMI cable, Power Adapter, Stand and of course, the display itself. Physically, the display looks so elegant with its near bezel-less design and the 4 way stick to use monitor settings at the bottom illuminates the bottom of the monitor like a spot lite. Perfect for keeping your gamepad controllers (you can disable the light if you want to). The Arc stand looks awesome, provides good support so display doesn't wobble and doesn't take so much space as well. It also supports VESA mount so you can get 3rd party mounts for it that suits your taste better.. Coming to the ports available. This display supports HDMI 1.4a, DVI port, VGA port and a 3.5mm audio output jack so that you can connect your speakers to the monitor and it will use the audio via HDMI and output it to the 3.5mm jack. The display comes with the HDMI cable included.. This display has 75hz Refresh Rate and 5ms Grey-To-Grey response time. That's certainly good for an IPS panel, most of the other display in this price range are either 60hz IPS panel or 1ms TN panel. As you all know, TN panel lack the colour accuracy that IPS has to offer. The display out of the box will suit anyone's need but to get the best out of it, tinker with the settings a bit to find something that suits you best. The best thing about this display which prompted me to buy it was the inclusion of FreeSync. I own a FreeSync compatible AMD GPU and the FreeSync is heavenly. It automatically adjusts the display's refresh rate to match the FPS so it can eliminate stuttering by sudden FPS drop or tearing getting more FPS than Refresh Rate. It's something you need to see for yourself to realize how smooth and fluidic the game plays on this display. The display supports 40hz to 75hz of FreeSync range. The blacks are deep, display itself is bright enough to be used in any scenario. Colour spectrum is amazing. I have set same wallpaper on a laptop with 1080p IPS panel (Lenovo Legion Y520) and on this monitor. On this monitor, the wallpaper had a gradient type look to it, starting from Navy Blue and slowly transition to Cyan where as on the laptop which has an IPS display itself just looked like a flat dark blue colour. There were areas which were completely blank on the laptop screen but showed details like rocks on this display. It's amazing how good it looks!. Cons - The stand doesn't allow for vertical height adjustment so you'll need to change your chair height rather than display height.. The HDMI 1.4a standard is ""technically"" capable of delivering enough bandwidth for 1080p 120hz monitors but it's not officially supported hence if you try to overclock the monitor via CRU (yes you can overclock the monitors too) then the display just says unsupported input so you can't really overclock this monitor. It will stay at 1080p 75hz. You can however modify the FreeSync range from default 40hz-75hz to anything, I have mine set to 20hz to 75hz. Overall - I think this display looks the best in the price range with some good specs to back it up with, 1920x1080 @ 75hz and FreeSync with good colour gamut coverage, good stand and most of all, all this within 10,000. It will not disappoint you. Just buy it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I noticed that this monitor has an hdmi problem. It does not work with your hdmi port from a laptop tablet etc. I called in lg customer care and they told me that i have to pay 500 bucks plus cost of its motherboard in order to get it fixed on warranty. I was shocked. I warned them about consumer court and slowly they came to their senses. I had everything on call recorder hence i was able to negotiate with these money mongers. Finally their representative came with a new board and replaced it, but here comes the surprise even the new board was defective and the monitor is still not accepting any hdmi input.

Reviewed in India on 2 October 2017,Ashish Bakshi,Don't buy cheap IPS,"Extremely high purple/blue IPS glow. It has no blue light filter. In daylight it is still tolerable, but at night you have to lower the brightness. Even the minimum brightness is too high, so you lave to lower the contrast, which completely washes out the scene/texts. Please don't buy if you want a good viewing experience, particularly at night. Especially bad for reading, even in reading mode. The black text appears as purple. Reading mode does not reduce the blue light, rather jacks up the red and green (yellow). You can use custom settings to make it slightly more bearable, but it is impossible to live with this thing for the next 5 years. Even my old Samsung TN screen has better contrasts. All the online hype over IPS screens made me order this thing. Totally disappointed. Returned it. Please don't buy cheap IPS. If you want cheap monitor then buy TN or VA.

Reviewed in India on 24 March 2018,Vaibhav Jain,BEST BUDGET GAMING MONITOR IN WORLD,"INTRODUCTION :. :::::::::::::::::::::::::. If you are looking for a great monitor, your search has ended. Without a doubt, it is the best budget gaming monitor . It is also the best monitor for video editing, movie watching and Internet browsing under 10,000 Rupees. And I will also try to explain, why it is better than its competitors, the Dell S2216H and HP 22ES, which are also awesome monitors under 10,000.. WHY THIS MONITOR IS INTERESTING :. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. Under the budget of 10,000,. a) It is among the very few monitors which are :. * 1) 21.5 inch (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, Benq RL2240HE, Samsung LS22E310HY/XL, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),. * 2) Full HD(Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),. * 3) IPS (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES,LG 22MP58VQ),. * 4) Matte screen with IPS panel (LG 22MP58VQ and Samsung LS19F350HNWXXL(Glossy with PLS panel) ) (others have either glossy screen with IPS panel or matte screen with VA or TN panel). b) And is the only one which has :. * 1) Free-sync technology,. * 2) 75 Hz refresh rate(All other have 60 HZ). Please write in comments, if I am missing any monitor in the above list, so that others can read it.. ABOUT BRAND :. :::::::::::::::::::::::::. LG makes some awesome products and they keeps providing cutting edge technology in its monitors. No wonder, we see them so much on youtube and other websites.. BASIC INFORMATION :. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. I will try to explain what these terms mean in brackets after the specifications.. * Size 55.88cm (22). * Panel Type IPS (Best panel type for color reproduction). * Color Gamut (CIE1976) 72% (Color gamut refers to the various levels of colors that can potentially be displayed by a device.). * sRGB Coverage 86.1% (This is most common color gamut. Other are Adobe RGB and Photoshop RGB). * Color Depth (Num of Colors) 16.7M colors (Most common color depth. 10 and 12 bit color depth is for serious graphic designers). * Pixel Pitch (mm) 0.2915*0.2915 (Distance between centre of pixels to other centre of pixel. Lower the distance, sharper the image ). * Resolution 1920 x 1080. * Brightness(Typ.) 250cd/m2 (It's ok. Many other monitors offer the same brightness). * Contrast Ratio(Original) 1000:1 (Here VA panels are better, which offer better contrast ratios of 3000:1 like Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM. Better contrast ratio means deeper blacks. But for IPS 1000:1 contrast ratio is common.). * (DFC) Mega (LG's DFC is a meaningless number. Dynamic contrast means nothing, it's marketing jargon.). * (GTG) 5ms (Its not great, but its good for gaming. For awesome 1 ms response time look at TN panels like Benq RL2240HE). * Viewing Angle(CR‚â•10) 178/178 (One of the strong points of IPS panels is great viewing angles. No color distortion even if you look from very side). * Surface Treatment Anti-Glare,3H (Matte screen is a must have, if you have lot of light in your room). * Display interfaces D-Sub(VGA), DVI-D, HDMI (Many others have only two of these three display interfaces). * Audio output Headphone Out (Audio quality was not good, and why would anyone connect headphones to monitors instead of their PCs). * Maximum Power Consumption 17.6W. * Sleep Mode Power consumption Under 0.3W. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION :. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. * Also comes with cable holder, which is a detachable plastic part, that comes separately with the monitor and attaches itself to back of stand, and manages cables, so that you cannot see cables from front. It keeps things neat and managed.. * It is VESA mount compatible. Many budget monitors are not VESA mount compatible.. * Comes pre caliberated. Not many do. You get a printed 'color calibration factory report' with monitor inside box. You don't need to adjust anything by going into menu, if you don't want.. * Not all IPS are good but this really is and shows a lot better image than TN panels.. * You see sharper image on 22 inch 1080p screen, than 24 or 27 inch 1080p screen. As all three screens have same number of pixels, smaller size will have more pixel per inch than bigger screens.. BONUS INFORMATION :. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::. I am really enjoying this monitor. If you like to have lots of features at low price and still want good quality product, this monitor is for you. Honestly I am waiting to see which monitor will come to dethrone this one, as the best budget monitor. I mean which monitor will be able to add more features than this one without increasing the price and still maintaining the quality.. I have many stories to tell, about my experience with this monitor. How I connected this with different PCs and laptops and how it interacted differently on them. Not going to bore you guys with details but a word of advice try to use this monitor over HDMI, as it works better and adds feature instead of VGA.. You also get OnScreen Control Software with this monitor, which I liked. Its simple to use. You don't have to control monitor settings from menu by using the joystick but you can do it from this monitor using your mouse easily. It lets you add display presets to different applications. And the presets will change automatically, when you switch to different applications. For example; if I add Reader preset to Microsoft Word and Cinema preset to VLC player, the brightness and contrast will go down whenever I switch to Word and will go up, whenever I switch to VLC.. You can also use screen split feature with one click from it. Screen splitting is that you can split your screen and look at two, three or four windows at a time on your screen. For example; I can look at chrome and word, side by side and I will not have to switch between them again and again, if I am doing work which needs both of these applications. Although, Windows 10 and some other free softwares like WinSplit and GridVista,offer split screen feature, but I liked this software. It's easy.. Also the main thing. It really shows sharp image quality. Color and contrast are fantastic.. THE STAND OUT FEATURES OF THIS MONITOR:. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. As mentioned above, it is the only Free-sync monitor available under Rs 10,000.. In short, Free-sync technology allows the monitor's refresh rate to continuously adapt with respect to graphic card's frame rate. So, in a instance if your graphic card was generating 48 frames per second, your monitor will adapt to show 48 frames per second. All other monitors are fixed at 60 Hz or you can say that they are fixed to show 60 frames per second.. Now the question is why your monitor needs to adapt according to graphic card. Because it solves two problems which are,. 1) tearing, when frames per second generated by your graphic card are more than 60Hz(or what monitor can output). 2) stuttering, which is generated to solve the problem of tearing by using Vertial sync technology (V-sync). Watch some youtube videos to understand better about Free-sync. Without watching these videos, you will not understand tearing and stuttering. And without understand them, you will not understand the need of Free-sync.. Some basic things about Free-sync :. 1) You will need a AMD graphic card for taking benefits of Free-sync. Because Free-sync is a AMD technology. NVidea has similar technology with name G-sync. But G-sync monitors are very costly in comparison to Free-sync monitors. And I am assured that they will not be available under Rs 10,000 for a long long time.. 2) You unlock 75Hz refresh rate when you unable Free-sync.. THE PEOPLE IT WILL BENEFIT MOST :. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. Gamers (even with Nvidea graphic card, as they also get 75Hz), Video editors and designers (as colors are important for them, which they cannot get on TN and VA panels) and any casual user(who simply uses computer for using mails and watch youtube videos) will benefit from this monitor.. Laptop owners who want a bigger 22 inch and higher 1080 resolution matte screen in comparison to their mostly smaller 14 inch and lower 768 resolution glossy screen.. BEST PLACE TO BUY FROM:. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::. Buy it from amazon, because many old units come with VGA cable. And here you get new manufactured units with HDMI cable. I received such a new unit that it was manufactured on 25th April in China and I was using it on 4 th June. Approximately 1 month after it was made. Quality of HDMI cable is good.. PROS :. ::::::::::. * 1) Free-sync. * 2) Anti glare IPS screen. * 3) 75 Hz refresh rate. * 4) Crisp image quality. * 4) Black stabilizers, for adjusting screen's gamma curve, which helps in seeing dark areas of games easily.. * 5) Awesome Onscreen Control Software. * 6) Best budget gaming monitor. CONS :. :::::::::::. * 1) Bezels are not as thin as many say.. * 2) Stand can only tilt, has no height adjustment or rotation. And also wobbles.. * 3) Only one HDMI.. * 4) Shows some IPS glow.. * 5) Glossy plastic back and stand.. * 6) Because of its popularity, it might not be available or sellers might increase their prices in future.. * 7) No speakers. ALTERNATIVES :. ::::::::::::::::::::::::. If you are not interested in many of the features present in this monitor you can also opt for Dell S2216H, LG 22MP58VQ and HP 22ES. Which sometimes go down in price. But HP22ES has slow response time of 14ms (GTG).. CONCLUSION :. ::::::::::::::::::::::. I didn't expected something like this will ever come under the price of 10,000. But it did. It's undoubtedly the best budget gaming monitor around the world.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 18 July 2018,Nikhil Tamhankar,Certainly the Best Budget Monitor for Creative Content Creators,"I am beginner graphic designer and I plan to work a lot on Adobe Photoshop, After Effects and Premiere Pro. So I bought this budget monitor. And instantly after testing it, I felt like sharing my experience with you. So, here it is.. Pros:. 1. I have moved to 1080p monitor from my Dell 3542 laptop's 15 inch screen of resolution of 1366x768, so of course switching to a full hd 1080p IPS LED monitor was overwhelming. I really liked the huge space that I get in the timelines of After Effects/Premiere Pro and also the workspace of Photoshop and Illustrator.. 2. Bezels are so thin that I feel like I am working on a very large screen monitor.. 3. If you install the monitor software, no need to find the buttons physically on the monitor to adjust the display setting (monitor only has one buttom in thr bottom center). The software can be used to set everything like brightness, contrast, Picture-by-Picture (PBP), AMD FreeSync on/off etc, which in my opinion is better than traditional physical buttons.. 4. Comes with a HDMI cable.. 5. Build quality is a very good.. 6. Monitor stand is easy to setup and feels like sturdy.. Cons:. Honestly, there are none. I purchased the item during the Prime Day with HDFC card 10% discount offer and I got for around 8500/- bucks. At that price point, I have nothing to complaint about. I loved this monitor so much that I would have purchased it for 9500/-, but luckily I had an HDFC card to avail the offer. Certainly, this is the best monitor you can buy under 10000/- in my opinion.. Note: Buying an UltraWide monitor like 25UM65-P is also a good option however the reason I went with 22mp68vq is below:. 1. Don't know why but the user reviews of 25UM65-P on Amazon were not that good like 22mp68vq when I checked.. 2. You would think that since 25UM65-P is a 25 inch Monitor, it would be larger than 22mp68vq, but that is not the case. 25UM65-P monitor actually is smaller is height due to its 21:9 aspect ration unlike the 16:9 of the 22mp68vq. Think of UltraWide 25UM65-P like the horizontally extended 20 inch monitor which means that the height of the 25UM65-P is equivalent to that of a 20 inch monitor. So you if you are planning to purchase UltraWide, better go with the larger display. Below is the reference website.. 2. The 22mp68vq monitor is way cheaper than the 25UM65-P. The difference is so much that I thought I would purchase a Pen Tablet by saving the difference of amount I would have to pay for 25UM65-P. Besides, as mentioned in above point, I would have to go for larger screen which is even costlier.. Conclusion: As a beginner creative content creator, I am very happy with my decision to purchase this monitor. if I find any flaws in future, I would definitely update the same in this review.. Disclaimer: Above review based solely on my experience and presented as my point of view. I hope this review helps you making your purchase decision.. Go Creative, Go Crazy!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 24 September 2018,Tanmoy B.,Best Monitor under 10K,"I bought this thing primarily for gaming, movies and occasional studies. Boy I was surprised at the picture quality I got. I was going in for a TN panel but decided to go for ips one for color accuracy sake. I am glad I got this one. The screen size is perfect for a desk PC. It has got really thin bezels which is good for multimonitor setups.. The best part of this is that it has got freesync and range is 40-70 Hz which is really good. SO now I can save about 25% of my GPU power and still get a smooth experience. coz playing at 45fps vs 60fps doesnt feel any different now. I use it with R3 2200g and i set all my games chill fps limit b/w 75 and 40 Hz.. It has also got 4 screen split mode (see linustechtips video). Never used it though. It also has preconfigured photo, cinema, game and reader mode which is awesome. just change the mode with a single button press. It comes a long HDMI cable about 4ft.. The colors and image quality are accurate and after using this for a month I am never going to use a 720p screen again. It comes with a wire manager hook that attaches to the back of the base.. Cons -. 1) It has a forward tilt of 15 degree and a backward tilt of only 5 degree. Wish it would have given a back tilt of 15 degree also.. 2) The height is non adjustable, but hey at this price what better you can get.. 3) Installing is fairly simple but detaching it from the stand is a pretty daunting task, as you will need a screwdriver to unlock the latch on the stand.. Overall an awesome product.. There are cheaper monitors which have same specs but doesn't have HDMI (freesync works over HDMI and Display port Only) or freesync in the same price range. But I would say investing a bit more in a good freesync monitor would go a long way, as how much often do we upgrade our monitors, maybe at the very least 5 yr or so, but games get demanding every year. So if you maybe playing at 60fps now but in 2 yr you will not be able to sustain 40fps in new games, thats where freesync kicks in.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 24 August 2017,Nidhin,"Nice monitor, fits my requirement","Was in need of a display that can be used as computer monitor and to watch tv. LG had more models but finally decided not to go for monitor/tv models bcoz of slower response time (14 ms). Needed full HD and HDMI and didn't want the display too big bcoz I will be sitting close to it. zeroed on this one, bought it from brick&mortar store for rs 9500.. As very detailed reviews has been written i am not going to repeat whats already written. the monitor does wobble as many has written, but only if you touch the monitor and not the table. Even though the monitor wobbles, it's a slight movement and is not going to topple. The base is heavy enough to keep the monitor firm and doesn't wobble with along the monitor, only the screen wobbles.. The picture clarity is very good, I tried playing some Bluray on it and it looks astonishing. The videos have been panned and zoomed to fill the screen and you can find a nomal one too with black bars on top and bottom. I know these images are not enough to show how it look on the monitor, but just to have visual. those white streaks, your eyes cant see it, only camera picks it up.. Will add more later",4.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 18 November 2018,Neko_San,Good for the Budget,"I'm going to shoot straight.. The backlighting bleeds on this panel from the edges, especially noticeable in dark scenes. This isn't just limited to this panel though and I'd wager that most IPS panels without multi-zone backlighting suffer from this. So if you're looking for better black levels, don't buy this because a similarly priced TN or even a VA panel would be better.. Things that I liked:. Vesa mount support, awesome if you own aonotor stand.. Colour accuracy is awesome and would probably surpass other panels in its price range.. Despite the lacking blacks, the whites do shine on this panel and the contrast is good as well.. Wide array of picture adjustments and the included joystick is such a pleasure to use.. Things that I thought were meh:. There is no monitor height adjustment. An absolute miss imo from LG's end.. As mentioned earlier, there is edge backlight bleed visible in dark scenes.. Very restrictive connectivity options with no option for Display port or USB.. No quick screen turn-off toggle.. 75hz refresh rate is only achievable on an AMD GPU..

This monitor has HDMI, DVI and VGA along the side you get headphone out jack so you can hook your headphone or speaker systems to it for audio which is great.. I am using this Monitor as my TV and Monitor both.

Setting up the black stabilizer well can help the editors. It has very good view angle at the same time. It provides flawless gaming experience as a monitor made for gamers.. The biggest feature of the monitor is undoubtedly the addition of freesynce within its budget compared to g-sync. Its HDMi frequency is 40-75 Hz. According to the most reviewers 40-75 Hz is the sweet spot for freesync. You can unlock the 75 hz refresh rate by turning on freesync from the menu. It has a set back though, when the freesync is enabled you wont be able to see the bios, however you can turn off the freesync when you need to access bios menu. Where freesync can almost make the frame rate change unnoticeable. We tried gta v which is running at 60 Hz with our nvidia card. Color looks vibrant and there was no response time issues. We changed the response time to low from the settings to get the most out of it.We spent a good deal of time in gaming and i have to say gaming this good at this price is insane..

(Please don't buy a lower Hertz monitor if your have a higher Hertz laptop or another monitor, trust me your eyes will hurt seeing the difference). And, out of luck it was not returnable :) so I was stuck with it.. Luckily there was an option to boost it to 75hz with nvidia G-Sync.. Ohh yeah, it's not written there but it does support G-sync along with AMD's free-sync!. So, enabling Nvidia G-sync and boosting the monitor to 75hz made it a little better, and stutter and lag was gone (not entirely! But it was better).. Definitely not for gaming. I needed this monitor for work so It didn't bother me much!. I will never think of gaming in this one :p. It does have a good picture quality and good support for multi tasking!.

I have been late jumping into the LCD monitor wagon.. After reviewing various options, it was clear that 22""/ 21.5"" was the sweet-spot for price to screen size.. For normal desktop use, this monitor is more than adequate, a little on the luxury side.. When the correct graphics drivers are installed, the maximum supported resolution is 1920 x 1080. It leaves a 0.5mm border on all 4 sides. It did make me think if it was normal, but on second thought, I felt that it was necessary to get an exact, non distorted image. So this avoids all kinds of manual settings.. It has D-Sub, DVI-D and HDMI connectivity, although only D-Sub cable is provided. The audio is carried through the connecting cable and is available on a 3.5mm stereo jack on the back of the monitor. The monitor does NOT come with any built-in speakers.. It comes with preset viewing options such as custom, cinema, reading, photo etc. that can be set by a jog control below the screen panel in the center. It also comes with a software CD that allows the monitor to be controlled from the desktop. Be aware that the software does not support XP and that is not good..

I've had this issue with 2012 rMBP too when connected to a Dell 23 inch display with HDMI. But this one is definitely better than that. One other issue is that the display wobbles. Yes its got some wobble to it which can get annoying sometimes. For gaming it'll get 5 stars. For work 3 starts. So overall 4 starts..

Netflix in edge or windows 10 app will not play above 720p.

Reviewed in India on 4 September 2016,Mridul Gupta,Good one.,"Alright so i finally got this monitor after a day of delay in delivery.. Will directly jump to what i feel about this monitor after using it for 3 hours.. Great colour. Black levels arn't as high as i expected it to be but is pretty good, colour expression covers it up. 1x HDMI port, 1x DVI (Probably DVI-D, not sure) and 1x VGA.. Am currently using VGA cable and have an HDMI cable ordered.. This monitor has some IPS glow which i have in the left bottom and left top side. Not that bad and is actually pretty common.. I though noticed some very faint horizontal lines during the display of black coloured content. Could be a VGA cable problem but if it is not solved with the HDMI cable. I'll probably ask for a replacement. Not that its unbearable but still, the angle this monitor is for my display, those lines are still noticable.. It has only one button to control monitor functions like contrast, brightness. Its like a joystick control. I like it.. My old monitor is a cheap LCD acer one so i like this, only if IPS glow was a bit less and the black lines werent there, it would have got 5 stars.. I dont care about shaking since i dont plan to keep it on a shaking surface. Though if you place this in a windy room or room with good ventilation, monitor may shake a bit that that is okay in my opinion, not that noticable.. Good one.. ----Update----. So i decided to replace the monitor. The Horizontal line issue wasnt fixed and i also started getting corrupt screen upon resolution changes on both HDMI as well as VGA usage. Waiting for the replacement to come and see if it is the issue with my monitor or with the whole model range.. ----Update #2----. Sorry forgot about my review XD.. So i got the replacement, went through some trouble but in short, got it.. So the horizontal line issue is still there. It definitly is the problem of this model range. The lines are not noticable in other colours except grey. You can kind of see them if you have been using computers for a long time or are a geek.. Also buy a good HDMI cable, i would recommend a bluerigger HDMI cable on amazon, that cable works great. Do not use VGA or analog DVI with this monitor as it can cause corrupt screen issues which is definitly not desirable. I mean if you are buying a monitor priced at around 10k, why not add 500 INR more and get a decent HDMI cable through which you can connect it to your PC.. This monitor is capable of 75 Hz @ 1080p, its not mentioned here so i will let you all know.. AMD freesync is an Addon you get here along with flickr free though it doesnt matter much unless you are gaming on it.. Colour reproduction is very good, and black levels great though ips glow ruins it when you are in a dark room.. Anti glare coating works great,. The light bulb behind me does not bother me much now. Although anti-glare coating comes at its own disadvantage though not a big one. When the screen is white, you actually can see the affect of the coating, though not much. Its hard to explain what it looks like but well, it isnt that much of a bother. Dont decide not to buy this monitor only because of this anti-glare thing on white display, trust me, its not at all an issue. I just mentioned it to let you all know of my experiences.. Also, when you get the monitor, go to monitor menu > picture > picture adjust. There, set the black stablizer to 0 if you are watching movies and all. Also if your movie does not have many black scenes, especially movies like batman, in the same place, set black level option to low. What this helps is that, it improves the colour on the cost of dark scenes being more dark. I tinker with this setting a lot.. Thats all i have experience with this monitor. I bought this monitor mainly for watching movies, animes, basically watching videos and for adobe products. I have a TN panel monitor which is currently set up in a dual monitor setup along with this monitor with the help of my Graphic Card AMD R9 380. I do gaming on my TN monitor and all kind of other work on this monitor.. Pretty happy with the product, if you are tight on budget, definitly go with this monitor.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The colours are vibrant and the anti-glare finish is quite pleasing to the eye. I am using it primarily for gaming (COD, Farcry) and haven't had any issues with response time, lag etc (although I am not a competitive gamer). However I did notice some odd behaviour while installing windows 10. The monitor was connected through HDMI and the initial resolution during setup was 1024x768. The colours were psychedelic and the monitor even froze a couple of times during initial setup and initial use. This happened when I connected using a GTX 1060 card as well as during connecting with HDMI on the motherboard. After installing the LG drivers and tweaking, I realized that this happens whenever the resolution is not the native 1080p.. To sum up, when it works it does perfectly. However dont get pertrubed in case you face hitches during initial installation when windows defaults to 1024x768,",4.0 out of 5 stars

Since I'm a gamer and my next rig is gonna be AMD based(Ryzen & vega),having freesync is a big deal for me.I consider myself a hardcore gamer and i also do photo and video editing and this monitor suits my needs perfectly.As you all know having LED IPS pannel is a must having for editors.The 75hz refresh rate is also another plus.Don't worry about input lag because belive me i notice no input lag at all. Always go with freesync as both it and gsync are the same thing except gsync monitors are very over priced.So if you are a gamer,you will get free sync and lighting fast response times & a high refresh rate.Also if you are a professional photo editor,the led ips pannel with deep blacks and super sharp image quality will surely help in making some jaw dropping images and video. In online games like battlefield 1,speed and responsiveness is what you need.So stop wasting time time and buy this beast as it's the only one with all these features(especially free sync) even under the 15k range.Plus no need to say about watching movies on this thing,it's just insane :D.
