Reviewed in India on 3 November 2019,TechMan,"Best 21"" 1080P Monitor, In-Depth review.","First of all It’s the best 1080P 22” 75Hz in it’s price(7500) and I’m saying it after my research based purchase and after purchase experience.. Contents:-. came with Monitor!, 2 piece modular stand, VGA cable, HDMI cable thankfully!, AUX cable nice!, power cord and power brick, some paperwork. *************************. Ports:-. HDMI, VGA, AUX input(can’t be used as output when sound is coming from HDMI), power input. *************************. Looks and feel:-. It’s so different and better looking than those full black monitor and on the inside it’s 75Hz display so it’s a totally different experience inside and out with this monitor, the white portion of this monitor stands out beautifully, the main display is half as thick as a usb plug display is matt finish so it doesn't matter if there’s light source in front of it. *************************. Display:-. Vibrant output, Beautiful color production, No dead pixels and no color bleeding. Some people had issue with color bleeding but not me, supports freesync and capable of 75 FPS output, I haven’t noticed any stain on eyes 10+ continuous hours and I’m a guy with glasses.. It’s a 75 hz display, i’ve used 60Hz display for 11 years and it makes a difference it’s only display in this price range with this feature and sealed the deal for me.. You can game on it no problems just know that this monitor doesn't sell as gaming monitor and gsync and display overclocking support is not available, it has 4 MS response time and is better at gaming than other similar monitors and some expensive monitors too. **********************. Speaker and sound:-. it has 2, 2 watt speakers in the bottom which is not loud at all and lacks basic bass I'm not asking for much just enough, for reference my poco F1 has loud and clear speaker than this dual speaker monitor it’s just there and you shouldn't rely on it but is a nice addition, something is better than nothing. For speaker to work you can give input by HDMI cable and if you are using VGA there’s aux input too. ***************************. Manual setting suggestion:-. This is a 75 Hz display so first of all check that your graphics unit has enabled 75Hz from normally 60Hz refresh rate to enjoy it’s full capability. Factory display setting of this monitor was with a warm color to give feelings of blue light protection which was not looking normal so you may have to tweak the settings to fit your needs. ***************************. One thing to keep in mind that it’s a 21.5 inch 1080P monitor which has a 102.46 per inch that means if you use it in its native resolution text might be smaller for you, text is totally readable and clear but small so I have custom scaled this monitor to 109% now everything is fine for the monitor but windows OS is bad at scaling some text are blurry like chrome suggestion which is totally not a big deal but something to keep in mind and if you buy 24 inch monitor the price of that is just shy of double the price of this monitor.. *****. If we are talking about eye care than this monitor doesn’t put strain on eyes just set it to comfortable brightness and use a blue light filter like flu.x or use windows 10’s night light feature",5.0 out of 5 stars

No major backlight bleeding issue like LG and Samsung have.(I attached a photo of dark scene to detect any bleeding). And the colour reproduction quality is just insane 🔥. Also comes with 2 piece of 2w speaker though it's not loud but it's better to have those.. The white colour is just giving it a look of extraordinary..

I was expecting a HD monitor with an HDMI extension as my laptop didnt have a VGA port. After a bit of research, narrowed down on this monitor after seeing the reviews - definitely not disappointed. I have been using this for over a month now. I can say that I am very much satisfied - have to wait for few more months to see its actual performace.. Pros:. 1. Really thin panel. 2. Provide HDMI & VGA connectivity for older PCs as well.. 3. Package has all the extension cords (HDMI, VGA, AUX, etc). 4. Has 2w in-built speaker - not so great but can be useful sometimes. You can use the AUX extension to draw the audio out from monitor to any external speakers.. 5. Stand is easy to fix and holds the monitor perfectly. Cons:. 1. Again very thin panel, looks delicate while handling - too risky if you keep moving your montior. 2. I see a blue light leak on top the screen - you will notice when you see that from top of the monitor (see image). 3. No wall mounting option - so those who work with multiple monitors can't put them in the strut bracket.. 4. Locating the menu buttons is too hard at times, there is no written description on the bottom panel rather acer has given on screen navigation. I always use the blue power light to locate the power button and from there.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 22 November 2020,PD,"Good product from Acer, but build quality can be improved","This is my 2nd ever monitor from Acer. 1st one was Aopen which I still regret buying. The Aopen is pretty bad display. So after my 1st experience with Acer I was reluctant to go for Acer again. I had a few options in mind like Samsung LS24R350FHWXXL, Dell P2419H, Zebronics ZEB-A24FHD, AOC 24V2Q. Each one had some pros and cons. But finally I decided to go for Acer - color and thickness of the panel.. received the monitor in good condition with an extra cardboard box packing on top of monitor company packing. As soon as I opened it, it just took away my mind. The white color looks awesome and the thickness of the panel is just too less for it to look the most sleek of monitors. Its bezel less and the colors are good too. Using this for a month now and all good, though initial few days it took time to adjust to the colors switching to this one form my old monitor, but now its fine.. Please don't buy this for speakers as they are worst, hardly any sound from them. So speakers are just a gimmick. I hope the stand could have been a little more sturdy. Stand looks awesome in white but if that could have been a bit more solid, it would have been great.. Overall, this monitor is worth a buy.",4.0 out of 5 stars
