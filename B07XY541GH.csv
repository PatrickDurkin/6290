Reviewed in India on 4 November 2020,Anand,It seems like a very good buy..After 48 hrs use and some experiments..!,"Just got it..!!. Packing and the quality of the product is impressive. The buds fit snugly & securely. No chance of them flying off my ears..Can confidently use them for out door workout. Tried some western music,movies & Roobaroo( AR Rahman)..Good. Pls note, I don't have any expertise to comment on bass, pitch or timbre. But it's nice. The charging case is sturdy and pre charged. So I was able to use the buds out of the box. The buds get attached magnetically to the case and the click sound on closing the case is quite reassuring. Got paired to my Galaxy S7 immediately. With newer mobiles, the connection might be even better. Charging via C type port. Product definitely carries value for money... Concerns- Rated ?? IPX5, yet there are concerns regarding water resistance. User manual warns against using water, alchohol or liquids to clean the buds. Charging ports stick up in charging case and attach magnetically to earbuds. While wiping with alchohol, is there a chance for a short circuit since the ports are precharged..? Shall give details regarding battery backup and shock resistance (accidental drops invariably happen, esp. in my case!) in a later post. For the time being, let me dive into some true wireless music..😊. After 48 hrs use. Satisfied with the purchase... 5 hrs play time in a single charge. Fast charged again for 15 mts and got a play time of more than 2 hrs..didn't believe that one in their ads.!. Disinfected both ear buds and case with alchohol spray and it's still working.. As expected,the buds fell from my hands a couple of times and had to carry my weight twice over various furnitures. No probs..",5.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 6 November 2020,Danny,Hands Down the best in 3k,"Im a music head my main purpose of buying these is im using oneplus 8 which does not have earphone jack which forced me to buy buds z, i bought these for listening to music when im traveling and playing games, coming to the review. How does the earphones look : 7/10. Case looks decent, but i like the onplus buds case cuz they have matt finish and easy to open with singlehand. What i dislike is the styling of the earphone they look simple they should have designed it better or gave more colour options and accent colours but cant complain cuz they r prised at 3k overall at this price range although they r made out of plastic they look decent. Features :. water and sweat resistance is there which is good when ur doing workouts but they r not water proof if u dump them in water just forget them they r dead.. Touch countrols this part is hilarious they have only one option which is double tap which skips a song, recive or cut calls thats it, they said they r building an app hey melody wonder when they'll make that app available for the users, oh BTW it has bt 5.0 which is nice. Comfort: 10/10. This the part i love abt these earphones they r very comfatable they r light weight and i can wear them all day man the r very comfy. Battery : 8/10. Oneplus claims 20 hrs battery with using case but i get around 15 hrs aprox with case and earphone. the earphone itself give u around 4 hrs of usage then u have to recharge them using the case. Sound quality : 8/10. As i said im a music head, i like ground shattering bass in my music. But i have mixed reaction on these buds.. Believe me bass is there and thumping but if u compare is to wired earphones like sony xb55 or sennhiser cx 275s which r my fav, these earphones produce rich and awesome bass, which oneplus buds z lacks. These tws earphones have 10mm drivers they produce very balanced crisp sound with good bass overall they perform good the highs, mids, and lows everything is good. Latency 10/10 if u have 1+ device. I play pubg alot i mean pubg kr version😉. These earphones r awesome for pubg. There is no latency at all ive tested many tws earphones but every earphone had some delay. But believe me these have 0 delay loved it and u dnt need to turn on fanatic mode. Final verdict :. at 3k i cant ask for more. build quality nd design is personal preference, for me i can live wit it no probs sound is nice but u can turn it to awesome by tweaking the eq settings, i use poweramp app to enjoy my music it has the best eq and other settings than any music app in playstore ive tweaked dolby settings in my device and eq in the music app wallah these perform awesome now im very happy with the buy, love these tws and i recommend these earphones, just go for it believe me ul love the comfort and sound quality it offers,i promise! if u want good looks u can skip but at 3k these r the best tws available in amazon",4.0 out of 5 stars

Cons as below,. -Does NOT have multiple device connectivity that allows me to connect to both laptop and phone at the same time, this was a very important requirement for me. -Audio quality is good, but only as good as the Boat 1 to 1.5k range of earbuds, nothing too great here. -Battery life is just about okay. -Every 5 minutes, there is a 2 sec drop and music goes off and comes back on automatically. -On voice calls, if I speak with just one ear bud on then the listener cannot hear properly. -Placing the earphone back into the case needs a bit of extra attention as more often than not I place it incorrectly (not a customer forward design). - Customization features for double-tap is poor, would have expected more options from Oneplus. With Oneplus Nord, I thought the company was moving back towards its original mission of providing great features at an affordable price, but sadly Oneplus Buds Z is just another me-too product from Oneplus. I think post the negative feedback of Oneplus Buds, the company wanted to slap on silicone eartips and reduce the price and thats what they have done here. You can get the same value at 1.5k earphones from Boat/other 4* rated brands I guess.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 2 November 2020,Shreyas Joshi,Excellent work by OnePlus. Not recommended for heavy bass lovers. Max volume limit is an issue.,"I'd rather give it 4.5 instead of 4 stars. Each and everything is just right and it's rightful credit goes to OnePlus who introduced the silicon earcups to enhance passive noice cancellation. We can toggle about how to use each of the earcups between play/pause, next/previous track and activate voice assistant. As I own a OnePlus smartphone, the moment I opened the charging case to get the buds, instantly it got connected to my OnePlus smartphone using the Quick Pair feature which is awesome. The sound quality is great and bass is good, but for heavy bass lovers, I won't suggest these buds because their sound quality is very much balanced with its treble and bass well balanced. The only thing which prompted me to give 4 stars instead of 5 was the ""maximum volume level"", which I think is very low. You cannot simply increase volume beyond a certain limit on these buds, so, if you are in a place with lots of noise around, you might not be able to listen to your music clearly.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Couldn't take three steps before I need to hold the earphones from falling off. Bass is lackluster and nothing to boast about, like how people are describing it. Worst part is the interrupted play. Been meddling with it since few hours now and I still can't play a full song without it pausing by itself in the middle!. Update:. Ordered a replacement. Figured almost all the issues were due to the size of the ear tips provided. In the first package, I had a pair each of medium and small tips. New one had three small and one large size tip. The large size tip works fine for me and is entirely a different experience. Suggest everyone facing issues with auto pause and fit to try a larger bud size.

So I will list out all the things you need to consider before buying this:. 1.If you are buying this for using with laptop. Don't buy it. Because the buds have a problem with laptop connectivity and there is even a one plus thread on that and plenty of users complained there but oneplus does not have any response for that. The left and right buds keep switching on and off and it is extremely frustrating. I have used plenty of Bluetooth earphones and I have never had this issue.. 2. If you are a bass lover, or even if you are a music lover, never buy these. These buds had almost average to bang medium audio quality and almost no bass. Even watching movies or series with this is absolutely not enjoyable.. It will make you question all the reviewers, how can all of them be so biased.. For 3000rs it is definitely not worth it, you can buy the renewed ones which are new for only 1400 rs. It is only worth for that.. 3.The silicone buds they provide are the worst buds and of the lowest quality and design.You can see in the images I shared. So I switched to realme buds as you can see in the picture and trust me the sound quality improved a lot. For a company like oneplus who believes in never settle I cant believe they have such poorly designed silicone buds.. 4.There seems to be uncomfortable feeling in the ear when you wear it. Whenever you remove it , it stops and it is extremely frustrating. And you cant watch anything by sleeping as the 3 second press will disconnect the Bluetooth device..

Reviewed in India on 2 December 2020,Vidit Pandey,Value for Money and comfortable. Can recommend for the price point.,"I was looking for a wireless earbuds due to easy to connect, portability part.. The OnePlus buds Z popped into my mind after their price reveal and sealed tips design.. These are my first True Wireless Buds, therefore my review experience is based on first time experience rather than comparison prospect.. Sound: The sound is ok, Personally I am not a bass lover and the bass is on average side. The low and mid tones are great (typically for Indian film music). One thing I would like to mention that amazed me was Gaming sound is amazing on these with no lag. (I played Call Of Duty Mobile paired with iPhone).. Connectivity: First time pair with iPhone was very easy. Afterwards, it connects by default as soon as I open the Buds case, which is very convenient. I use it with my laptop as well and meeting experience is good (mic quality indoors is great and good outdoors as well, no complaints).. Noteworthy points:. - As soon as you take out a bud, the music/video pauses. This is a really good addition at this price point.. - I would have loved multiple device connectivity at once, but even then switching among devices (phone to laptop or other way) is a breeze, just tap any bud for 3 seconds and it connects from one device to another.. - Comfortable to wear for 3-4 hrs non stop.. - Battery is 3-4hrs constant music/meetings. (Since I have experience with wireless headphones which give 20+ hrs of battery backup therefore this is not so good for me personally, but given the size and quick charge in case, no complaints here as well).",5.0 out of 5 stars

These low-cost buds are surprisingly comfortable, offer a fun sound profile and come in a charging case that features roughly the same size and design as the one included with Samsung’s Galaxy Buds+.. The OnePlus Buds Z look very similar to the older Buds, but this time OnePlus went with a silicone ear tip instead of the hard plastic AirPods-like design. The Buds Z include the standard small, medium and large removable silicon tips. I found that the tip coupled with the shape of the plastic fit in my ear a lot better than the regular Buds. The new earbuds also use 10mm drivers to produce sound, and in my experience, it’s very comparable, if not better than the 13mm drivers featured in OnePlus’ regular Buds. The only advantage that the Buds Z have is that since they have silicone tips, they block out a lot more background noise, which provides additional bass and clearer music in my testing.. When it comes down to it, I can forgive a lot of the shortcomings of the Buds Z since they sound so awesome. OnePlus uses sound enhancement tech it calls ‘Bass Boost’ in both of its earbuds, and it works especially well here with the sound isolation tips. Music features a clear and detailed range, and with my smartphone’s volume at about four quarters, I couldn’t hear anything around me.. If I were buying a new pair of earbuds today, the OnePlus Buds Z would be a pretty appealing option. I’ve used a wide variety of lower-cost wireless earbuds, and they often sound dull and flat, which isn’t a problem with the latest Buds from OnePlus.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The first thing that I like about it is the volume at which you can get a great music experience. To be specific it only requires 50% volume to give u an immersive experience.. The second is the bass, I have a Harman Kardron music system in my car with a bass tube, these earphones give the same effect without the shaking of body parts that comes with a base tube/ sub woofers.. Third would be call quality which is excellent this was the main purpose that I bought it. It I felt was better than a Voyager Legend.. Fourth is comfort, no ear pain whatsoever, plus never fell off the ear.. Miscellaneous pros: The usage time is good on a single charge, won't let you down. Noise cancellation is as required (at 50% volume there is some environmental awareness, which I feel is a good thing and at 100% it gives total noise cancellation.). Cons: The pressure senssors on the earphones are not well calibrated resulting in pauses while listening to music or watching videos. This I personally find very annoying.. Second is the limited set of controls on the earphone. The controls could have been much better considering that it is touch controls. This can be made much better with some software changes (hope OnePlus is listening).",5.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 30 November 2020,sreejith,"Convenient, but some shortcomings - ""Bullets wireless Z"" is better","I have a Oneplus 'Bullets Z' headphones as well, so this review is based on my comparison of Buds Z with 'Bullets Z'. Overall, I found bullets z to be more convenient and functionally superior to Buds Z, but buds z obviously has better 'style factor' since it resembles the apple air-pods.. The positives: The overall design is good, from an aesthetic point of view. The charging case is good, the charging is convenient. The sound quality is acceptable (I have used it mainly for calls and zoom meetings, not so much for music - so cannot comment extensively about sound quality). The charge stays sufficient amount of time.. The negatives (and specifically where I found 'bullet wireless z' better). 1. Buds look good, but there are some usability issues - e.g.: You are away from your desk and want to disconnect the headphones to talk to someone : with Bullets, I remove them, magnetically attach both the ear pieces and leave it down - then it switches off, and it will stay hanging around the neck. But with Buds, you have to have the case with you - where do you put the buds otherwise? it does not have the convenient mechanism of switching it off temporarily.. 2. Battery charge stays less than Bullets. I have used both on different days. I can see the obvious pattern than Buds empties charge quicker than Bullets.. But again, don't get the wrong idea. These are decent headphones, that look really cool. So they are not bad. Its just that for the style, you will have to compromise some usability and functionality.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 1 March 2021,Mahesh Patil,Good TWS with some connection issues,"Connectivity:. These are my first Bluetooth earphones (TWS earbuds to be specific). So I do not have a benchmark to test its connectivity. But as a user, it kept me wanting more. The pairing is very easy, especially with my Oneplus 8 Pro. Even the pairing with my laptop was quick and swift. The problem is, the connection drops frequently especially with the laptop after a certain period of time. First, the audio stops coming from the left earpiece and then from both the pieces. After split seconds, the connection is reestablished. This is so annoying. This problem is less pronounced with the mobile phone. But it happens once in a while. Also on phone, the connection drops automatically and it needs to be connected from Bluetooth settings. This has happened very few times, but it was so annoying. Checked the Oneplus Forum and lots of people have complained about the connectivity. The basic feature of any Bluetooth headphones should be a strong and uninterrupted connection. As I said earlier, this is my first TWS earbuds, I am not sure if this is a problem with all the TWS or only with this one.. Fit:. The silicon tips were not fitting properly in my ear, especially I had pain in my left ear after using it 10-15 mins. I tried all the ear tips to no avail. In the end, the extra silicon tips I had got for a Boat solved the problem. But as everyone has a different size and shape of ear, this is not a deal-breaker. The audio and video pauses when an earbud is removed from the ear. This is convenient but is problematic if you are using the earbuds while lying down. For me, one of the earphones keeps popping out when I use the earphones lying down and video/audio is paused. This is frustrating. But again this will be different for different users.. Sound Quality:. I feel the Sound Quality is good and balanced. Bass is balanced and overpowering. The audio separation is top-notch. The movie experience is awesome and engrossing. Satisfied with audio quality.. Phone Quality:. One of the reasons, I went for TWS was that Oneplus 8Pro doesn't have a 3.5mm head jack and I had to use USB C to 3.5mm converter. Switching between the phone and laptop was really a pain with the wired headphones. Didn't face any issues with phone calls. The person on the other side of the call never complained about the audio. So I think it's good. One thing I have observed for the last couple of days that the audio from left and right earbuds were not in sync for 2 calls. It was so weird. Not sure what happened. But overall, I am satisfied.. Switching Between 2 Devices:. I am connected with my phone and the laptop at the same time. To switch between the devices, one has to long press on the earbud. The switching happens smoothly. But the time to switch between 2 devices is too long, around 5 seconds and in reality, it feels longer than that with the phone ringing in front of you. This should happen much faster.. Battery backup:. I haven't measured it, to be frank. But I think it's around 3-4 hrs for earphones. TWS needs to have some kind of battery level indicators. It's very difficult to know how much is remaining. I know the Oneplus phones show the % but in real life checking it every time is not possible especially when using on the laptop (when not connected to the phone). I don't think any TWS in the market has separate battery level indicators on the earbuds. Everyone has it on the case. In a nut shell, the battery backup can be better.. Aesthetics and Product Quality:. Good. No complaints.. Price:. Seems reasonable. Got it for 2799/-.. Overall:. Rated 3 stars. Would have rated it 4 stars had it not had the connectivity issues. But again with this price range and the Oneplus brand name, I can live with it (after all I have already paid for this, so no option :) )",3.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 1 December 2020,nagpal e.,the Most Critical Points I found.....,"I have used the Oneplus Buds Z for a week now,. Here are 5 issues that I faced :. 1. When I am in a call(zoom,teams,etc.) then the sound quality deteriotes to an extent that the song that you love will just become a light tone with a very bulky voice. So no dual mode in terms of call and non-call use but for non call use the sound quality is just amazing but lacks dual mode which we see in wired earphones. 2. The buds have a quick switch mode in which they swiftly change the device for that you just have to hold the touch pad for 3-5 seconds but the issue is that sometimes when you are in bed or just sitting and listening the music and you unintentionally hold the touch pad then the buds disconnect and music stops which is very annoying, it would have been great if they(oneplus) gave us the option to enable/diable the quick switch option.. 3. On a continuous use of call mode, I found the battery backup to be round about 4 hours when I started with 100% battery on buds (This is without case).. 4. I am a non-oneplus user, that's why the functionality of the buds are a bit less, the HeyMelody app is buggy like it sometimes doesn't detect the buds so then I have to disconnect the buds and connect them again which annoys but it would really kind of oneplus to launch a specific official app for these buds.(I heard that buds have different modes that they work but unfortunately it is restricted to oneplus devices only). 5. You need to have the buds in correct positions so that your voice is caught by the mic because if you don't pay attention to that, then the person on the other side of call has it difficult to hear your voice.. 6. Sometimes the gestures switch their places like if I aligned left to next song and right to pause/play then sometimes they switch places like the left will respond with pause/play and right with next song, which I fix by going to the HeyMelody app and again aligning them.. (optional)7. Easy to lose because of small size but I think that is something you will have to deal with any TWS you buy.. Although, these issues aren't a big of issues so if you are going to buy them I would highly recommend doing so and are a great value for money.. If you ask my opinion they are absolutely great and you must buy them. People have a notion that a versatile thing cannot compete in a singular factor term but luckily that's not the case for these buds,so if you are looking for a good TWS, I would recommend you buying this.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 9 March 2021,Andrew Clement,"Good pair of TrueWirelessEarbuds for the price, with room for improvement in critical areas!","Written based on daily use with my Oneplus 7 Pro for Calls, Gaming, Watching Videos, Listening to Music for 3 months,. Pros:. 1) Connects really fast. Pairing is super quick. If you get a call, you can quickly slap these on and within 2 seconds, be ready to answer hands-free! Very convenient.. 2) Audio quality is decent and you will not find it ""lacking in quality"" even if you're coming from a higher end wired Sennheiser CX275s or a Sony MBR. You will adapt to it soon.. 3) Latency is almost non-existent when playing games like PUBG Mobile, this is an extremely good pro about these buds. Not many buds can achieve this. However, latency can be observed in popular video streaming apps, but is very minimal and you will get used to it. Weird how that works! It's almost like it was fine tuned for PUBG Mobile.. 4) Passive noise cancellation is good, but could have been better. The silicon tips do not fit in as snugly as you would like. Not that it's bad in fit, but not as good as the snug fit and passive noise cancellation you would get from the default tips on the wired Sennheiser CX275s.. Cons:. 1) Frequent audio drops (1-2 seconds) even when using it on a Oneplus device. Gets very annoying when you're in the middle of a movie/TV series and an important dialogue gets cut out and you have to rewind and play it over again. Happens consistently.. 2) If you launch a game while playing music in the background, expect a brief audio drop. Similarly, when you exit the game.. 3) 75% of the time, call quality, especially at the receiver's end is good. But sometimes, voice gets muffled, recipient complains of not being able to hear voices clearly. (I'm someone who uses these buds for calls all day, everyday, for extended periods). 3) Battery drains quickly when used for long calls. Be prepared to have a backup device if you're on important calls all day.. 4) Cannot be used with your mobile while lying down sideways on the bed. It is NOT that it is physically uncomfortable, because it is not. It is very comfortable even while lying sideways. The problem is that lying sideways triggers the long press action on the buds that disconnects your phone to pair it with another (last paired) device. There is no option to disable this and it's very annoying.. 5) Buds cannot be customized very much. There is only ""Double Tap"" option on each side. So at most, you can configure one side for fast forward, another side for rewind. For play/pause you remove one earbud to activate the auto pause feature.. 6) False Triggers in Auto Pause gesture: If your buds are not properly aligned even slightly, the auto pause feature will get triggered accidently which is very annoying.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 14 March 2021,mackblend,🤏🏼 close to being the best under 3k,"This review is after almost more than a week of extensive use of the product. I have used the product with MI A3 and not a OnePlus mobile device.. 1. Sound feels good at medium level. It gets pretty loud when you bump up the volume all the way. There is a very sharp and clear sound when you listen to podcasts. For music the bass is not bad the mids and lows are pretty good for the price point.. 2. There is no active noise cancellation not there is any noise isolation buy it somehow fits well in my ears and cuts some noise.. 3. Definitely not a comfortable device to wear for more than 3-4 hours. The ears started paining and kind of felt like something is poking in the ears.. 4. The Bluetooth connectivity is average. When you open the case, there are times when the device doesn't gets connected. So that seemless connection isn't there. Probably should work good with OnePlus phones. The range is okay like there is not much one can do with Bluetooth technology.. 5. Only if OnePlus would add the play and pause gesture on the pods it could have made a best deal for all the non OnePlus user. There are sensors though which pauses the music when you remove one bud from the ear but doesn't really makes sense cause when I hold that bud in my hand the sensor gets activated and resumes the music which makes it hard because the only place you can hold it from is the stick. It really sucks that the OnePlus app is not available for any other device than OnePlus.. Conclusion - In and out the device serves it purpose for the price point of 3k but I would really like if they could just add that play and pause gesture on the device similar to the skipp music gesture which is already there in the buds.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Call: The call quality is not favorable at all and Onplus really needs to work on this. While you are on call, and if the other party speaks simultaneously, there are absolutely no chances of hearing the person even though you have peaked the volume to Max level.. 2. Signal Drop: There has been constant signal in this device and I wonder why such occurrences are happening in such a branded device, especially while you are connected to your laptop, and watching any OTT platform, youtube, the sound suddenly breaks in between for 1/2 seconds and comes into action on left ear piece followed by the right. Thees instances occur in frequent intervals.. This was even experienced while I was listening to music in my smartphone. I believe this to be some kind of a technical glitch with ""In-Ear"" detection. This was the most unpromising part which I felt.. 3. Dual Connectivity: this device does not connect to 2 different devices at the same time. Now living in a WFH culture, one would always like to get this option for a device costing 3k bugs.. 4. If your ear pinna is smalller, please do not consider this product as continuous usage even just for 5 mins will make your ears to pain making you to shift it's position at constant intervals.

The race of tws is never ending, by increasing the price the sound quality also increases, so please dont judge the 3k tws's sound quality so much, as you know that tws is a whole new technology so with time everything will get better.. Instrumental separation in buds z are awesome. You can easily detect the snares, drums, percussion, melody if you want to focus on a particular section.. I was really REALLY realllllly worried about the bass quality of this buds but after using it for 3 days i can easily rate it 4.5/5 for its price.. At last guys i want to share a line that i had heard during my research of finding the best tws under 3k was- ""GUYS, AGAR TWS LENA HE TOH BHAI LELO JO BHI PASAND HO, RUKNA NAHI KI AUR ACCHA AYEGA AUR ACCHA AYEGA"". Because its a never ending cycle just like smartphones, today you'll buy snapdragon 730g under sub 18k and 6 months later you'll get it for around 13-14k.. So if you want a reputed brand's tws with a fine sound & build quality, GO FOR IT !",4.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 20 January 2021,Manjunath,The Average Consumer Audio Nightmare,"They're... Well, alright. The low end is strong, but it lacks tremendously in the mids and the highs just seem like an afterthought to the sound. I hate that OnePlus is suppressing the mids in favour of the bass. The sound lacks personality, it's just consumer audio. One thing I loved about the Bullets Wireless 2 was that they were relatively quite balanced. These are a straight up nightmare in the sound signature, so I had to manually EQ them to boost the mids. Bass heads might enjoy it. But vocals sound almost muffled. Highs are annoyingly bad.. They're comfortable, easy to carry and last long enough that you won't feel like it's a burden charging them. But the sound is horrible for anyone who isn't a basshead. It takes away the soul from the music.. tl;dr, buy if you're a basshead, or just looking for cheap wireless audio. Otherwise, consider Sennheiser if you don't mind wires at this price.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 12 January 2021,Sakthi Prakash .M,Very Unreliable,"I have been using this for 2 weeks now and I have lot to share.. First of, the battery. I don't know what non sense is this, left and right ear buds drain battery unevenly. To top it all, when you charge it in case, it fully charges only one. Also the app doesn't show correct battery status. I called the customer care, and he has a readymade reply of ""go to the oneplus store"". Funny how few stores are there throughout India and he expects me to get a day off, spend petrol for a mere 3k product.. Second, the connectivity. For some reason it decides to pause my track frequently and it's not the connectivity that causes it. Also the range is pretty low too.. I have been using Sony Extrabass wireless since 2016 and Sennheiser 4.50 BTNC for 3 years. Not once did I have any complaint.. Oh! I almost forgot one thing. The capacitive touch makes me choose between either play/pause and forward or play/pause and backward or forward and backward... can't have all three. And they call it true wireless.. Audio is good, on the bass side more. More suited to music not for movies/audiobook.. Pretty sure Amazon filter this review out",3.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 23 December 2020,Gaurav G Bhattacharjee,Pretty bang for the buck,"I bought these directly from Oneplus store app as the grey version wasn't available on Amazon.. These are absolutely great. I have to take a lot of online meetings and a criteria for any TWS for me is that they should work well with these online meeting apps too. And the Oneplus buds z don't disappoint. Watched and listened to music with these in phone as well as laptops. One neat feature they have copied from Airpods is that the moment you take out one of the buds from your ears, the music stops playing and the moment you plug it in, the music resumes. Very handy. I have airpods pro too and the only few places these stay behind are noise cancellation and not too great bass. However the sound clarity is unbelievable. These are very light too. After a while you totally forgot that these are there in your ears. Finally the call quality is pretty good too. Go for it. At 2990, these are so very good.. Edit : I have seen many people complaining about low audibility i.e. low sound while on calls. Try the simple trick. Reset your buds. Place the buds in the case. Open the case. Press the button at the back of the case. A red light appears and then a white light appears. Reconnect to your phone. Dial someone. Lower the volume through the phone. Then power up the volume. Your buds audibility issue would be resolved.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 26 January 2021,krutika Desai,Good only for oneplus phone users. But could have been better.,"I bought this from oneplus store. Gray color. This was a gift for my sister. On receipt of the buds, she found there was static while receiving calls and music automatically stopped.. As oneplus doesnt give refunds, they said they would replace it. However the service centre didn't even replace it. They said they have updated the software and asked to recheck the device. If the issue persists, they would replace the device.. So I tried out the device on my oneplus 8 pro.. I wish to point out following things. 1. In order to enter pairing mode, one has to press the button at the back of the case till led light on case turns white.. 2. The oneplus buds app had some issue on automatically connecting, i got it connected manually.. 3. The sound is excellent. Bass and treble are decent.. 4. Con: This device doesn't support multi taps. On double tap on earbuds work which can be customised to play/pause/skip track/ next track only via oneplus buds app. For others who can't have oneplus buds app, there literally cant do anything. There is no option for single tap or triple tap function for the buds.. 5. Con: As soon as you remove earbuds from your ear, they stop playing music. So even if you renove one earbud music stops playing. You can't use the buds as a mono bud. Really sad.. Conclusion: While the sound quality is good compared to price of rs.2999/- but there are many features missing that we require for daily use. Like single tap/ triple tap/ long press for few seconds, using only a single bud for listening to music and so on.. I would recommend on buying a better device which has the above mentioned features.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Reviewed in India on 23 February 2021,Sumedha,Perfect for the use cases I was looking to use this for,"Was looking for a pair of headphones primarily for:. 1. Taking calls from the laptop at home / office. 2. Connectivity to 2 separate devices - Phone and laptop. Features which were important for me:. 1. Clear voice quality over calls both for me and the receiver. 2. Convenience of use (avoiding wires and bigger headphones) in day to day scenario. Features which were not as important:. 1. Noise cancellation (as I was primarily using these in a relatively quiet environment). 2. Sound quality for Music (Other options would be better, not looking for good quality sound from these). Why this was a good fit for me:. 1. Convenient to use and a small footprint - Connects pretty much instantly when I take it out of the case. 2. Havnt got a complaint regarding call quality from the participant on the calls. 3. Comfortable to wear. 4. Price -. > Battery for these earbuds would be pretty much unusable in 2 years time in best case scenario. > Even if I get an Apple airpods, my use cases would remain pretty much unaffected. > So if get these to run for 1 year, they come out to be 3 times cheaper than airpods (considering I can get 2 years of use out of those). > If you are looking for sound quality then get an over ear bluetooth headphones, the sound space from those are not something these earburs (Apple or otherwise) can match",5.0 out of 5 stars

Reviewed in India on 16 January 2021,Vriddhi Dua,Good buy as per the price!!,"I’m using One Plus Buds Z with my iphone and I think the overall experience is good. It takes a few seconds to connect which may be slower than a One Plus but once connected, you can enjoy good music. The only think missing I guess is that we don’t have a HeyMelody app for iOS so you can only make adjustments and check the battery status on an android phone using this app. In One Plus phones, you can check the status directly I guess. The built of the case is nice but it is delicate to handle. So you will have to put it in a case or a pouch to avoid scratches or harming the case. The magnetic feature of the inner case grabs the air bud once you keep it closer to put it inside the case. The sound and bass are nice, while the calling is also pretty good. Noise cancellation is decent, you will hear background noises if there’s a lot of noise like on roads. But otherwise, I think it’s reasonable as per the price.. Overall good buy as per the price.

Reviewed in India on 19 December 2020,Vivek Rajput,"Best TWS For Rs 3000, Affordable And Quality Both At Same Time","The OnePlus Buds Z is priced at Rs 2,999 in India and it is one of the best options you can buy. The OnePlus earphones have always had a very natural audio quality to them. And this is the reason why over the past many pandemic months I have been using the OnePlus Bullets Z as the earphone I use for the long hours of office calls. The OnePlus Buds Z takes this legacy ahead with a neutral profile that offers the right mix of mids and highs.. PROS:. Good Overall Audio. Comfortable Fit. IP55 Rating For Water-Dust Protection. Decent Battery Life. USB Type-C Charging. CONS:. Very Limited Touch Controls. Best Used With A OnePlus Smartphone. I felt like being transported somewhere else when I played 'Bewafa Tera Masoom Chera', Singer's voice cutting through the music that was filling my ears softly. The bass on the Buds Z is just right and not the type that wraps everything and gradually overpowers everything. Here it is happy being in the background. But when it has a role to play in the new Punjabi songs, it does play its part.. As I stated earlier, budget TWS earphones usually sound “decent enough” and most of them are tuned for higher bass output to appeal to the masses. The OnePlus Buds Z goes for a similar approach but does not lose sight of its elder sibling’s properties. For Rs 3,000, there’s nothing else in the market that sounds like the OnePlus Buds Z.. The vocals are where I felt the Buds Z slightly lacking. The emphasis on the bass masks the vocal clarity, which is evident given the 10.3mm drivers. However, as soon as you consider what it costs, all of these are merely nitpicks. The OnePlus Buds Z only supports the AAC codec and that means it sounds nice on the iPhones. On Android phones, it lacks the higher-res AptX codec, which could be a bummer for the audiophiles. I tried it with both an OnePlus 8T and a Xiaomi Poco F1, and both of them held the performance levels on par with what you get from iPhones.. OnePlus promises up to 20 hours of battery life on a single charge (including the case). In my usage, I used it for calls and my music sessions, all of which last an average of 1.5 hours to 2 hours at max. It has been over 12 days and the battery indicator still shows green every time I take out the Buds. I guess it will take one more week for the LED lights to blink read before I put it on a charge.. Charging itself isn’t an issue. Once I got it out of the box, I left it on the charge with my OnePlus 65W charger and after 1.5 hours, it showed the battery was full. OnePlus says you can charge it for 10 minutes to get 3 hours of playback. Sadly, I haven’t had the chance to test this as my Buds Z hasn’t run out of charge still. I guess this isn’t bad – as long as you can stay away from charging the better it is in my opinion.. Overall Quality 4.5/5. Bass 3.9/5. Treble 4.2/5. Comfortable 4.5/5. Charging 4.8/5. Overall, the OnePlus Buds Z is in books a balanced set of earphones, that will please all types of users and not put off anyone. In the price band it plays in, the OnePlus Buds Z has to be massy like this and that is exactly what it does well.. *Issues In OPB Z*. The OnePlus Buds Z impress in the crucial areas but there are certainly a bunch of issues plaguing it. OnePlus smartphone users can directly customize the controls on the Buds Z from the Bluetooth settings while other Android users need to get the HeyMelody app from Google Play. For iPhone users, there’s no app and that means they will be left devoid of any firmware updates or customization options.. The controls themselves are limited on the earbuds and I would have liked to see volume controls onboard instead of the rather useless voice assistant shortcut.",4.0 out of 5 stars
