  Was kind of Spectacle about buying a Renewed iPhone 8. When receiving it, it came in a generic box. iPhone looks like new and it will be a great Frist phone for my son. Would of liked if it came  with an actual apple charger and brick instead of a bootleg one.

  Received a defective phone:1. The boot screen would display a line either above or below the Apple logo occasionally. It would either show as a green line or a static line2. There was occasional lag when swiping through home screens and opening apps. I compared it to a friends iPhone 8 and the problem was specific to the phone I received3. The touch screen would not respond occasionally4. The battery would not display correct percentages. I once had the phone charging for 20 minutes and the percentage did not increase at all. After restarting the phone it showed the correct percentage.  This also happened while using the phone — the percentage would not decrease until restarting the phone5. The speaker sound quality sounded poor compared to my friends iPhone 8

  A word to the wise, have BREED check the IMEI of what they're sending you. IMEI's are specific to GSM or CDMA, and even if the phone is fully unlocked, if the IMEI doesn't match, it won't work. For example, Verizon and Sprint have compatible IMEI's, and AT&T and T Mobile are compatible.I got a phone, and the IMEI did not work with my network, which is how I learned about all of this.A word on BREED, though. They are very easy to talk to, and very helpful. I doubt you will have any trouble reaching someone who can help you get the right phone for your network. I returned my phone with no problems, and they were very understanding about the difficulty.

  The phone came as described in awesome packaging (as in, not just a cardboard box). The phone works great, it's fast compared to my iPhone SE, and was nearly flawless cosmetically. It had the signs of good use with a couple of scuffs, but that was covered up by the case I purchased. Besides, cosmetics don't affect the performance of the phone.Something I was a little leery about was the description, so here's my experience: The phone I received was unlocked and works great with Ting. The description said unlocked, but some reviewers mentioned that they received a GSM phone, and I was looking for CDMA. I received a phone that was unlocked that worked on either carrier network. I purchased from BuySPRY. I hope they don't mind I mentioned them.It is my understanding and from my research that unlocked and fully unlocked are roughly the same as carrier unlocked and factory unlocked. However, if the description specifies a specific network like ""unlocked GSM,"" then the phone will only work on GSM networks. Make sure to do your research on the phones before purchasing and contact the seller with questions. That's what I did and it worked out to my benefit.

  The product came with a scratch and little divet on the screen. When I first got it, it had a screen protector on, so I thought the screen protector had the divet- nope.  After accidentally dropping it, my phone screen cracked right through the divet. I have not had this phone long and am pretty disappointed as It is not even usable now. Now the screen shows many lines of colors. I should have sent it back at the beginning when I saw the divet but was willing to work with it. Make sure you do your due diligence when you first buy it to send it back if there is any issues with the screen!It’s a true unlocked Apple phone. Worked with at&t and Verizon (we switched carriers).

  I purchased this IPhone 8 for my mother in law. The phone was in excellent condition and operated perfectly for two months. After two months of use she could no longer get service on the phone. After contacting T-Mobile it was revealed the there is a carrier block on the phone and it cannot be used because the previous owner never paid the phone off. Just be aware this could happen and verify that the phone is clear and unlocked.

  I ordered 2 phones, and should have expected the worst since what I got wasn't all that. One phone has a bunch of mini screen scratches, a few deeper ones, and an extremely deep one that was unavoidable (photos attached just of this one phone). Along with that, the phone came with a few dents and scratches around the edges anyway (which was ok and what I expected). The other phone I got had very very very few screen scratches and the minimal amount of expected dents on the side. On top of that, the way the home buttons felt when you pressed them felt different between the two of them. Both phones turned on fine, sound worked and touch screens worked normal. However I didn't even bother setting them up since I was going to return them.Since this item is $150 less than a new iPhone 8, doesn't come with Apple charger or headphones, the price difference wasn't worth it in my opinion and I ended up returning both of the phones. I'm leaving two stars since one of the phones was in decent shape and since I expected to possibly return these phones anyway. Just expect the worst but low-key hope for the best because in my case with was pretty much night and day between the two phones.

I do need to invest in a converter or some new headphones for the new port.

The hardest part of the upgrade was getting the sim card tray to open on my old phone.  My previous phone was also a refurbished unit which worked flawlessly for nearly four years.  I've had the new phone for about a week now and there is a lot of new functionality that I have yet to use so it will keep me entertained for a while becoming familiar with them.

  This was a gift and an upgrade from an iPhone 6. I don’t want to talk about the iPhone tech— go to a apple for that. I want to talk about the fact that it’s a refurbished iPhone for a ridiculous price that had me worried because it seemed toooo cheap. Well, it worked out without any issues. I can vouch for it being unlocked because it’s currently being used in Tokyo on a non-American carrier.

  After reading some of the reviews on the reseller BUYSPRY I was actually terrified of buying this phone. Probably one of the riskiest clicks I've had to do.However, the phone arrived neatly packaged, exactly as advertised, with cable & wall charger and it looked brand new. There were a few light scratches on the screen and on the glass behind but the type of scratches that are only visible under certain angles and with lots of light - Personally not a problem at all. At first glance, it looks absolutely spotless - like a new phone. Battery capacity/health (the you can check at settings) was at 97% which seems pretty good. Overall, so far ZERO complaints. Phone looks amazing & works just as good.

In the process of returning it and hopefully finding a fairly priced phone from a different seller that does work before the holidays. Would definitely NOT recommend

  I should have known better- as soon as I tried to turn the phone on to set it up, there were problems. The phone was not responding to charging or me pressing the home/power buttons.I finally got it to turn on and assumed it was just a freak occurence (I was mistaken) and began to set up the phone. The phone kept resetting itself or shutting down completely throughout the night. Again, I blamed it the amount of data I was transferring from my old phone. (mistaken again)I used the phone for a few days, and it reset or shut down probably an average of 5 times a day. Sometimes the phone would freeze completely and become unresponsive to any buttons, touching, or even my attempts to force it to shut down. I would just have to leave it alone for an hour or until it reset itself again.I ended up returning the phone, and asked to exchange it for one that worked. The company faied to do so and sent me a refund instead. Now I am without a phone right before the holidays and must scramble to find a new one. I will not be buying this phone ever again and I recommend that you don't either.

  I usually seek refurbished products as it is a good way to get quality devices at slightly lower costs than buying them new. I found this listing and I will admit that I was a little skeptical about making the purchase because of how few reviews there were. I contacted the seller and asked if there was any way that I could be assured that this would be a good purchase. They were very polite and gave me all of the info on the warranties provided by both them and Apple.I received the product and it was in MINT condition. The phone had absolutely no sign of ware whatsoever. It has been working perfectly for 4 months now, and I could not be happier with my purchase.The packaging clearly wasn't original and the charger was not OEM, but this is stated in the product description so I knew what I was getting into. No big deal.If you're the type of person that is willing to give up a fancy unboxing experience to save about $100, this is an excellent option for you.Additionally, I had no problems switching this phone over on my Verizon account. As long as you are a Verizon customer, this should be an easy process through the Verizon app.Thanks!

  I purchased this for my wife. I was VERY hesitant to purchase refurbished especially when you see reviews of phones not working at all or where product details warn against using phone with any carrier other then ATT. We use cricket, which uses ATT towers. Happy to report, phone arrived fast, condition was excellent (no dings, scrapes, scratches, or any physical damage whatsoever). Packaging was a repack ( not original box) but was re-wrapped, included new cable and charge block, phone was nearly charged to full. Included a nice screen protector. Setup was simple as new, no issues with transfer. My wife has been using for 3 days now and loves it (so far). Will update after 30 days but so far, very pleased and glad We purchased.**UPDATE** 30 days in and still no issues. Very satisfied customer

The seller send me a grapevine in a very good price, if you don’t feel like dropping $800-$900 on a new phone as I have done in my last two iPhones I would highly recommend purchasing it from here as I am super happy, and I am very careful when it comes to electronics purchasing online, thank you Amazon I appreciate your business and thanks for amazing product.

  I received my product on 05/21/20 and it upon opening my package, everything seemed okay. I went to turn on the phone and it seemed dead. No biggie, I could charge it and it’ll work. Wrong.The first red flag: the plastic covering on the charger was loose and came off of the metal attachment to the chord. I was able to slide it up and down the actual wire.Second red flag: I had put the phone on the charger and left for about 30 minutes, expecting my newly unboxed purchase to be nearly charged. Wrong.The phone didn’t even turn on. I had it charging for two hours, tried multiple power-up techniques, all to no success. My phone is faulty. It’s just a lifeless piece of glass and metal.I won’t get into the shipping because that’s another story. But after shipping delays and paying additional shipping charges, it’s a little frustrating receiving a phone I can’t even use. I will be returning the device tomorrow and will not be ordering from this seller again.I should have taken the negative reviews seriously. Maybe if there wasn’t a pandemic my order would have been fulfilled, but I can’t take that chance again.

If battery was replaced with new before selling these refurbished phones it would be an excellent deal. As is you can consider it a decent deal I expect a year or two out of the phone...

  I was a bit hesitant with this purchase because of the mixed reviews but I ended up buying it . It came in just today and works perfectly fine. The phone came without any scratches and without any trouble connected with Cricket easily . I ordered the phone full unlocked and based on others reviews was a bit scared of getting it with another company or getting it not unlocked. The phone came in with a charger but no headphones. You'll have to use your own tool when it's time to remove the sim card. Overall for right now the phone works fine but will update the review if any problems come in the few days.

  Hi guys, I got the phone, it was unlocked as advertised, no problem for my carrier and I am in Europe. The phone works good for me, I've had it for a couple of days, although the battery capacity is at 89%, it can hold up to 2, 2 and a half days with talking and surfing, no charging. It doesn't restart, as some comments here say, which was what I was worried about and really the value for money is great. Apart from a couple of dinges on the side, visually the phone was great, it even had a protector on. For the people complaining that the battery capacity is not at 100%, just go change it, it's like 20 bucks and don't forget this is not a brand new phone, so for a refurbished phone that I got I can say I am pleased.

  Battery was terrible from the moment I activated it. Phone started randomly shutting off and restarting just weeks after receiving and now it’s completely gone and won’t even turn on. Not worth the investment and such a hassle and inconvenience. Would have much rather put that money towards a new one since it costs about the same between the price of the phone and now the cost to fix it.

  When I got the phone, I was disappointed, but not surprised by the 85% capacity battery inside. I expected I’d be taking it in to Apple for a battery replacement, anyway. But, when I took it to Apple, they couldn’t replace the battery. They showed me pictures, where there was standing water and corrosion inside. Needless to say, I was shocked. Not only did I have the phone in a waterproof case, I only had it for a few days, and NEVER had it near water. I immediately contacted Amazon, who contacted the seller. The seller asked if I’d submerged the phone. I couldn’t believe it. After a few days of emailing, they agreed to a refund. I asked for a different phone with a full capacity battery as compensation. I use the phone for work. I missed out on money. They said they couldn’t oblige that. But, they did refund me promptly after reviewing the water damaged phone.

  [Refurbished iPhone 8/64GB. Bought on Jan. 2021.]As the price difference between iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 settled on a rather negligible sum (~ $20), I reconsidered my decision of buying the former (for ~ $160) and thought it to be wiser to obtain the newer model instead. [1]The phone arrived in an Amazon-iPhone-box; the box contained the phone, a booklet, an iPhone needle, a charging cord and a chord-wall connector (these last two were of different colors and do not appear to be of Apple brand). The box came without any earphones/earbuds – unlike what was testified in some of the earlier reviews.Visually, the phone had no scratches or marks – neither on the screen nor anywhere on its body. The entire exterior appeared to be completely indistinguishable (to a naked eye) from that of a new phone. Fingerprint reader functions slightly worse than expected; because the inconvenience is minor (i.e. several attempts being required before successfully unlocking via fingerprint vs. the usual single successful attempt when using the fingerprint verification method on my old phone), the effect of this issue on my opinion of any given phone is not so significant negligible.Thus far, I have been using this phone for about a month and overall it has been working well. However, for me, one of the most important aspects of a phone is, undoubtedly, its battery life; unfortunately, in the case of this phone, the battery life had been somewhat compromised well before its arrival.For comparison: the peak battery performance of this phone --  iPhone 8/64GB -- is 84% upon ~1-2 days of use after purchase (purchase state: refurbished), whereas the peak battery performance of my old phone -- iPhone 6/32GB – is 94% upon ~ 3 years of use after purchase (purchase state: refurbished).An observation to be tested/confirmed: The phone rapidly loses its battery life upon mildly cold weather conditions -- ~  0 – 5 Celsius or  ~ 32 – 41 Fahrenheit -- despite having a rather thick leather cover on and barely being used. A fully charged battery is completely drained in about an hour or less if used under comparable weather conditions. If left unused, the result seems to improve by approximately halving the battery drainage speed, i.e. approximately “doubling the battery life.”The battery life seems to be affected also by the background app activity (but to a much lesser extent if compared the cold weather conditions); however, it is much trickier (than it may initially seem) to control this parameter: The “Background App Refresh” on/off button in the settings menu does not appear to serve its intended purpose – most of the applications continue to function in the background as it pleases them, and, as far as I can tell – (perhaps even completely) independently of any of the phone settings.On the other hand, considering its refurbished state, as an informed buyer I, admittedly, understand what I had signed up for; so, as sad as it can be, it is hardly surprising to discover most of the cons of this phone to be connected to one of the most significant (for me) aspects of the phone – battery life.Finally, taking into account the affordability of the product, its quality, as well as factoring in its projected short life-span in this rapidly innovating world [2.], I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to all those in search of a new phone. I will try to update my review as new and significant issues come to light.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1.] Although it may be worthy to note here that the two phones at the above-mentioned price-points had different memory capacities, I find it difficult to reconcile that a productive person may use/need 32GB or more memory space in a personal phone; thus, any memory capacity succeeding this number is categorized as “a phone with enough space” and treated similarly in terms of that parameter.[2.] Considering the fact that most of us use any given phone for a very short period of time ( I wouldn’t guess it to be longer than 2-3 years), and considering that this already short time period tends to get even shorter over time – due to innovations happening faster and faster and the pace of the change – the development -- accelerating with an overwhelming rate, a phone that already has seen years worth of usage, represents the yesterday (and thus is soon to be replaced with something way more interesting), and costs the fifth of its initial price while functioning essentially only ~ 15% worse than it used to when it was completely new, in my eyes – is a worthy trade.

The company has offered to replace the phone but I would have to return this one 1st and be without a phone while I wait.

  Siri does not work and causes serious crashes.  I can use the Home button for anything but Siri.  When I use it for voice text or reminders, the phone will do one function and then go into vapor lock, requiring several reboots and a timeout (power down) for at least 10 minutes to work again.  In the past I depended on Siri a lot, so it has been a big problem. And then I missed my 90-day guarantee window to get the problem resolved.  Know why?  Because I didn't have Siri to remind me to get it done in time.  This has been a sad waste of $300.

    Risk Paid Off -- Take the Plunge, People--Also, Buy a Protective Case
  
","









  
  
    
  I almost never write reviews--I think it's worth doing so here.  Many of them here scared me.  But, given that it was half the price of what my mobile carrier sold, I took the plunge and bought the product.  I waited with morbid curiosity for it to arrive after seeing all of the negative reviews here.  It arrived several days early and had one very small crack on the bottom left-hand corner that I really had to spend some time looking for to see why on earth it needed refurbished in the first place.  Within 48 hours, I made a larger blemish to the poor R2D2 when I dropped it screen-side-down on my hard floors in my apartment  Luckily, the relatively small cracked section that my spectacular feat of juggling awesomeness caused didn't affect the visible part of the screen and added my own personal touch to the party,  I guess, so the disaster mostly was avoided.  This experience made me come to terms with the fact that it's only a matter of time before this device accidentally ends up in my commode.  Pro Tip: I highly recommend ordering a case as soon as you order this so you don't end up like me.The iPhone has no issues whatsoever absent its operator, who is a darned klutz that never should be allowed to handle electronics absent close adult supervision.  In all seriousness, I am thrilled with this purchase  Apple designed them to be slippery.  See that you buy a screen protector.

  Absolutely thrilled with this iPhone. It is beautiful. I purchased it for my daughter and she loves it. I have a Samsung Galaxy S9, and am considering making the switch to iPhone because I like this one so well. Everything works great, and it shipped really fast. It was a bit difficult to hook up to Straight Talk, so I would recommend just calling their customer service once you receive a SIM card from them.

  Received the phone and it seemed ok at first. The IOS was about 3 major versions old so I tried to update it, but for some reason it couldn’t.  Long story short, after several hours of trying to fix it and a few more with apple support, it was determined that the hardware was bad. Seems like this could have been determined when doing their QA, but I’m guessing they don’t do much if any. On top of all this after finding out that they sent me a bad phone, I had to pay for the return myself.  Happy ending is that I found the same exact phone for about $30 cheaper on another site and this one worked!

  The phone I purchased proved to be unusable as it was stolen and blacklisted from network use. When I contacted support, they simply did not acknowledge that the phone was stolen, and after three days simply asked if I'd received shipping labels to send it back, which I took as a tacit admission that they are well aware many of their renewed phones are from unscrupulous sources. I never actually received the shipping labels to send it back anyways.  I strongly advise anyone reading this review to head over to another seller because this one has not proven very dependable, at least for me. Hopefully in the future Kiss Electronics can find a way to take better care of their future customers than I was taken care of, because this transaction could hardly have gone more wrong for me and I'm incredibly disappointed.

  I thought this would be a renewed phone, as in, any issues from previous use would be fixed before it was sold to me. Nope. Screen has noticeable imperfections, battery is at 85% capacity, speaker crackles when playing music, and people say it sounds like I’m standing next to a waterfall when I call them. So the best I can say is that it is a functioning, if poorly, iPhone. The seller offers a refund, but I will have to buy another phone to use before I can send this one back.

  I gotta be honest I didn't expect to get a damn near perfect iPhone 8.It was sim locked to AT&T but less than 15 minutes after getting an approved unlock from their website and restoring the phone I was able to insert my sim card then use it on the CricketWireless service.There is one small tiny paint blemish on one of the edges but honestly it really isn't a problem because a case would cover it up easily. Other than that the phone has no scratches or dings anywhere else, battery is great, no Cloud lock and everything functions normally.I don't know if I got lucky or people are writing fake reviews but I am very pleased with my purchase and the fact that it comes with a 90 day warranty is a plus.Thank you for blessing me with a phone I could give to my mom cuz she loves having TouchID and having some newer features like wireless charging is a plus too (even though she's never going to use it).

  The product description says compatible with all network carriers (including Sprint) but after receiving the phone and attempting to activate it, I was told by 2 separate Sprint reps that the IMEI number will not work on their network. When contacting the seller they acknowledged this and only offered to provide a return label. I asked for a exchange for the same phone this time one that works with CDMA (not GSM) and my request was ignored. Why does the seller advertise ""All network carriers: untruthfully? It's a waste to time to buy from here is the need is CDMA. (Sprint and Verizon)

  So far I think I like Android phones better than iPhone, but this phone operates and looks like new. The iOS seems counter intuitive; maybe I'll grow to love it. What I do like is that it doesn't deplete its battery like an Android. Seems like a high quality phone, and not as pricey as new.After several months of use, I like the device very much. It does what it claims and doesn't seem to have a lot of stuff running in the background depleting the battery and causing overheating like Androids I've had. Still frustrated by the arcane lack of file management that forces everything through iTunes. Some files just don't get transferred to the phone. Not the fault of the phone; Apple Corp just won't allow convenient computer operations.

  I received the iPhone 8 with a new/free screen protector installed. This was nice but unexpected. Upon closer examination I saw what appeared to be a small crack or deep scratch on the screen so I removed the screen protector and verified there was a small crack along with multiple scratches. The lightening connector port was also dirty and had scratches. Ultimately, I did not feel it met the standard of being renewed and not worth the money spent.  I am in the process of returning the iPhone 8 and will find another vendor.

  I upgraded from an Iphone 6s to an Iphone 8. I had been looking around and saw this refurbished one on Amazon for $248 and decided to take a chance on it. I also had $40 of credits to use. I figured it's backed by Amazon with their 90 day warranty too. I don't play games or watch movies or any of those things so I didn't need to get the newest Iphone that's out there. My old one had 16GB this one has 64, so I'm getting 3 times what I had. I like the smaller size too which is another reason why I got the 8. They do ship it in a generic box with a generic charger.  The charger lasted 4 days and broke, good thing my old charger works on it. I've only had it for a week but so far, so good. I will update my review after I've had the phone longer.

  The phone arrived in great condition. No visible scratches and everything seems to work. Very pleased with the fit and finish. The battery health reads 79% after a few days of use, when I thought to check it. Entirely possible the vendor shipped it with 80% remaining.I am replacing an Xr, and I have to say I forgot how limited my last iPhone 8’s battery capacity was when it gave up the ghost. If you are replacing an iPhone 8 this may not be a big deal, but I’m going to have to charge multiple times a day if I talk for any amount of time. Just keep charges around your home, office, and vehicles and this shouldn’t be a problem. I feel that was the one trade off I made with a refreshed unit-battery life.

  Everything about this product has been perfect. The quality was indistinguishable from new, it has functioned reliably and perfectly since I received it. This would have been an easy 5-star review except for one thing:This is a refurb unit from Japan, which means that the camera shutter sound is hardwired in and cannot be muted, turned down, or turned off.That one little thing is enough to make this unit borderline unusable for me, as I primarily (used to!) use my phone camera for wildlife photography on hikes. Now a single exceptionally loud click sends every critter in the vicinity scurrying for cover.

  Literally ordered this on 12/8/20, received by 12/10. Beautiful phone, no scratches and just 2 small light spots on the screen. My daughter was able to plug it up and we took it to the be official registred with our phone carrier. Phone didn't hold a charge long, but we thought this was due to the phone needing to be charged (just arrived that day).  BY THE NEXT DAY we realized that the phone would not stay on without being on the charger. Tried another iphone charger (not the one that came with the phone), phone stayed on while off the charger, until you pressed the screen - INSTANTLY CUT OFF.  Took it to the Apple store for what I thought might be a battery replacement, but after diagnostics the problem is the device won't power on the LOGIC BOARD (BRAIN), so the device simply won't power on correctly. Recommends new phone...WTF!Now I have to send this back for a refund...there is no way that this company couldn't have known this if Apple picked up on it in 20 minutes.

  I ordered the fully unlocked version. When it came in the mail it was in new condition, no scratches or dings, and it came with the charger and tool to get my sim card out. We have a plan with Verizon, I was able to take out my sim from my old IPhone and put it in this one and it turned on and loaded all my stuff with zero issues. My phone is working fine and the battery life is just as good if not better than my last phone. So far no bugs or glitches. I'm very happy with my purchase. There were a lot of mixed reviews so I was skeptical on buying it but I'm glad I did! Plus it came with an amazon backed warranty so if one came defective I didn't feel like I would loose my money. My advice would be to pay close attention to your selection when adding the phone to your cart for service options and when in doubt go for the fully unlocked version.

  I have a love hate relationship with Apple. I will not buy a new product from them ever. Why? They brick phones with updates. That's shady. They smile while they do it too. So? Well it matters because that makes me a repeat customer of these second hand phones. Prices seem to be set competitively so that doesn't affect my choice of where my cash goes. What does have some weight in my decision making is customer service. I pay the asking price I get a device as advertised. Simple enough right? You would be surprised or maybe you wouldn't. The local places offering these devices have people behind the counters that don't seem to get what good customer service is. So.... okay. Get to the point right? I got a phone that works as advertised at a good price and I didn't have to deal with anyone so that's a plus. However, the appearance of the item was ummm .... acceptable had they not been sloppy in a weak attempt to cover up a blemish on the surface of the screen with a very cheap slapped on at the last second screen protector. The peeled backing of the protector was discarded into the corner of the box looking confused and I'm sure feeling slightly used.Have I mentioned it prior to this post? Nope. It really wouldn't matter had it not been so obvious of a weak attempt to cover something that wasn't as expected. Customer Service guys. Don't just don't. Will I buy another when the time comes? Yup. Whatta ya do? Smile and count your blessings these days I guess. It could always be worse.

  Phone was in near perfect condition. Packaging was basic, but that’s a good thing - Less waste than original Apple packaging. Popped in SIM card from old Verizon phone, turned on, and booyah - worked perfectly. My daughter has been using for over a month now and no issues at all.I will probably be buying a lot of phones for the family in the future through a refurbished seller like this.Shipping was a bit slow, and the tracking didn’t update until it was literally in the mailbox, but that’s probably due to the Christmas rush - still received it in time for Christmas morning, so no complaints.

  I love the iPhone 8 itself (I got one on release; this one was meant to replace a larger screen phone that I couldn’t get used to), but unfortunately this “renewed” phone wasn’t up to par. The description says minimal to no visible wear; however, the inch long gouge smack in the middle of the screen says otherwise. There are tons of micro-scratches all over the screen visible when held at an angle to light, but the gouge is way too distracting and obvious all the time (screen on or off, even looking straight on) so unfortunately I had to return it. I should have known the price was too good to be true.

  It’s fully functional and works just fine. I use straight talk and I haven’t really had any problems except at some point when I took calls I couldn’t hear them unless I put it on speaker but it went away and work just fine. Came with a tiny scratch on the bottom corner but I have a case on so I don’t see it. Same size as an iPhone 6 but the iPhone 6 has a louder earphone. I can hear through it but it’s not loud so that sucks but my phone works and it’s really nice. Came with a charger too. No earbuds unfortunately

  i purchased an iphone 8 -256GB which arrived oct 2,2020.  Tried to swap my phone to it and got error. Due to covid illnesses (family members) and other issues i sat this aside for a better time. In March,2021 i took to AT+T store and the device failed to activate for them also.  Took to yet another store 4/21 and it failed to active, and they did latest software update. Still wont work. Apple said it was a motherboard problem -primarily BaseBand IC.  Its unfixable.  The return policy is over, but .... am trying to find if i can get some refund.  Delays were my fault but the iphone is not usable.

  I order iPhone 8 as my primary phone broke and meanwhile I needed a phone to get by my day to day activities. This was my first ever encounter with buying a renewed phone and I was skeptical at first but I was pleasantly surprised.The phone came in a generic box with a iPhone compatible generic charger. Which was what I expected but seller went ahead and send a cover for the same. Which was kind of great.Coming to the phone itself. There were no scratches, cracks, or dent whatsoever with the phone. Had it been delivered in a genuine apple box I couldn’t have distinguished it from brand new phone. Battery life seems to be great. Every seems to be working great. Will definitely add more once I’ve used it for a while. Total bang for the bucks.

The phone was just thrown in some random phone box.Aside from that the phone was in great condition. No scratches no cracks. And the battery life which i was absolutely shocked at was 100%Good cheap buy for a good phone. I would recommend.

  This phone quit working properly right after the 90 days return window. When attempting to talk to someone on phone, you can hear the other person but they cannot hear you. This is not a problem with other person’s phone because it happens on every incoming and outgoing call made from this phone. In all fairness, there are no problems with texting, games, etc. but the main purpose of a phone for me is to make or receive calls. This is not an occasional problem, it is every phone call made or received. Also, I did not drop phone, get it in water, or do anything to damage phone. The phone has been in an Otterbox Defender since the day I got it.

  I have been using this iPhone8 for about a week as of 6/22/20 and it is working great on T-Mobile.  I bought one from another vendor and it too works as well. Great condition, looks new to me.  Battery life seems perfectly fine.  Audio is great, screen is great. No problems at all so I expect it will last.  Very glad I bought it.  Came with a charger and cable.  See picture

  I've only had the phone for several days but it seems fine.  What was amazing is that you can transfer via Bluetooth all your photos and contacts, everything from your old phone, iPhone 6, to the new phone and then just remove and swap the SIM card.  Done.  Didn't have to go to the AT&T place at all.

  This is the second iPhone I purchased from this purveyor within the past 6 months. First was iPhone 7. They accepted the return. The next is iPhone 8.  Each of the phones have failed due to error Update is required to use cellular data. Can’t make calls. The 8 was fixed once but now I am having that issue, and it appears it cannot be fixed this time. Obviously this company is selling faulty refurbished phones.Update, the above phone was able to be restarted. But, once again the phone has failed for the same reason. I’ll be paying Best Buy another visit. Hopefully they can work some magic and get it working again like first time, but they could not two days ago. Not optimistic.

  This is the best! My son loved it he was so happy about it! There is no scratches, No dents no nothing. It doesn't look refurbished it looks bran new! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking to buy a phone. Doesn't come with original charger cube but not really affecting how it charges. It charges really fast and runs out really slowly. Price is astonishing.

They offered for me to return it and refund the money... only thing is... I was charged around $ 150.00 if I wanted to ship it back ( if I wanted to return it I had to bring it back ). They offered to cover $25.00, well, buy it to use only in the US. 50% chances it is not unlocked. Had to pay $ 200.00 additional to have unlocked

  Iphone is my third or fourth iPhone.

So I spent Labor Day weekend withouta working phone.  Shame on Amazon for not mentioning this.  If I had known,could have had sim card home waiting for iPhone to arrive and iPhone did arriveon time.

  This phone works great refurbished, the only complaint is the battery life (only 80% max left after its original use). But all things considered, this phone was a fantastic value, works great, and I can deal with needing to charge it once a day. Probably still cheaper to replace the battery than try to buy the same phone brand new.

  Wholly unimpressed with Amazon's 'renewed' service.-- I bought a phone compatible with T-Mobile, but our sims wouldn't work. After an extended support call we found out the phone was locked to a carrier in Japan. It was suggested that I could call them to ask for the phone to be unlocked... yeah no thanks.-- Also: The phone just randomly shuts off. Mid-use, and the phone's screen is black and the button is unresponsive. Nice job at 'renewing'.So whatever 'renewed' means to Amazon, it is not ""refurbished, functioning phone"". Returning it and shopping elsewhere.

  I bought this phone to replace my grandmas iPhone she had. It came in a bland cardboard box with the phone in bubble wrap and the charging cable and charging wall plug wrapped up nicely but everything could shift around a lot in the box but luckily everything was safe and nothing broken. The batter life of the phone was at 91% meaning that was the max life of the battery so not too bad but a little low for my liking. Decent price, decent phone.

  I love the phone but it was not 256G only 64G and I really wanted the phone for the storage. I could have gotten a cheaper phone by just getting the iPhone 6s that was advertised as 64G! I hate I didn’t get to save money since the phone is the exact phone I already had but I had already promised my little sister my old phone and didn’t want to make her wait by sending this one back for false advertising. Great quality and was boxed very professionally!

  Very happy with my purchase! I just “upgraded” from my refurbished,  unlocked iPhone 6 64GB, and this phone is a great value for the money. I could not justify shelling out more than $1,000 for a phone, so after researching i settled on the iPhone 8 64GB in gold.  I shopped around, and decided to purchase on amazon because of  the Amazon Renewed policy, as well as the ability to purchase 2 year accident protection. My phone arrived with a few very light scratches on the screen (as described), which doesn’t bother me one bit as I always add a glass screen protector. The speed and functionality are also perfect, and setup was easy.  The battery life is not as great as expected, but not enough of an issue to decrease the rating. I purchased from BREED. Highly recommend!

  This phone came in great condition. No scratches or marks. Easy to set up. But the battery life was horrible. It only had 79% capacity and I couldn’t even get it to charge passed 12% while using it. Lost about 30% of battery life in the ten min I used it. I would have kept the phone if it weren’t for the bad battery. Great packaging and even came with a like new charger. But what good is a phone with out a decent battery.

  This phone arrived and appeared as described--like new.  Easily accepted our carrier SIM and worked great....for 6 weeks.  Yesterday the phone suddenly died.  I reached out to amazon and they connected us with Apple.  They tried in vain for an hour to get it working again but couldn't.  Ultimately Amazon accepted it to return (it had the 90 renewed guarantee) and off it went by UPS today.We've had good luck with renewed items and this may have just been a fluke.  But we decided to buy a brand new Apple Xr phone instead.

  This phone is not worth buying. The volume for talking on the phone is horrible. I can barely hear people talking to me. The people on the other end of the line are always telling me they can never hear me. When you get your notifications sometimes the sound is quiet sometimes the sound is super loud. When I close out an app and then turn the phone off and then come back to it later the screen will come up with something that I was doing three weeks ago and have since deleted

Was acting weird with my Polish sim card in the US but chalked this up to the fact I was in a different country than my sim card.  Got back to Poland, and problems continued.  85% of the time I have no service (phone or internet), even though I have an unlimited plan.  Even when in a safe wifi area, I have no service.  Basically, I'm without a phone if I don't have wifi to use whatsapp or messenger.  Phone is useless.  Very disappointed.

  This is a better iPhone than the 7S and any before it and at same time it’s not a better phone than 8S or any that have come since.I think the renewed standard has set a high bar, one which was not met with my order. There is a visible scratch on the screen that can be seen at an arms reach. I’m not sending it back to wait phoneless for a new one, but I think it’s a valid complaint. One that is probably common in occurrence but not often acted upon.Otherwise the screen graphics and interface is really nice, the processor doesn’t leave me wanting, and all these things are known by almost all iPhone owners. My review is about Renewed, and the difficult standard set that may offer more than what this particular  supplier is able to provide.

  We purchased two of these phones. One arrived with an LCD bleed, which at least allowed us to see the problem early enough to send it back in time for a refund. Please note that the problem was clearly visible as soon as the phone was turned on. It should have never been resold this way. The second phone would occasionally not connect to cellular data, a problem that got worse over time until it eventually stopped making and receiving calls altogether.I cannot stress enough the frustration you will likely feel at buying a ""refurbished"" phone that has seemingly not undergone any refurbishing. I'm sure others have had better luck of the draw, but there doesn't seem to be any quality control on what's being sent out. It is a waste of money and time, and you are better off not purchasing here.

  As expected, the battery was not at 100% capacity but it was higher than expected at 89%.There’s practically no scratches on the back or front of the phone and everything seems to be in excellent working order.I did not expect a charger or screen protector to come with the purchase but it did! The screen protector was already in place so I didn’t have to use the one I bought and I will be saving the charger the phone arrived with in case I need it later.This was listed as a FULLY UNLOCKED iPhone and I believe it has arrived as such, it will definitely work for the carrier I initially intended, which is Cricket.I believe my little sister has a step up from this phone (the 8 Plus) and she’s still paying for her phone through the provider. I’ve never bought a refurbished phone before this so I’m glad it worked out, if anything happens within the next 90 days before the Amazon warranty expires I’ll be sure to update. Definitely would buy the protection plan in addition to the phone, as accidents do happen.

  I purchased a fully unlocked (renewed) device and the phone was indeed not fully unlocked. Shipping was fast and the cosmetic condition was also as described. I have no complaints there. However, the device is void/null if it's not unlocked and thus, not compatible with my carrier. It was extremely disappointing as the description states that the device passed all diagnostic tests and was certified as being fully unlocked. This is MAJOR false advertising in my opinion. Still waiting to see how the returns process will go with the seller - I will update this review if it goes smoothly.

  I was having some trouble with the sound fading out and I was going to return the phone just 2 days before the deadline to return would be up, and the seller immediately provided me with a postage paid return label.  Then I spent hours on the phone with Comcast and Apple and it was determined that the problem was not with the phone but with the cell phone service.  (I had started having the same problem with my Android phone as I have 2 phones.) It is a long story but before I bought this phone I bought the same phone from the same seller because I had tried to cancel it because I had failed to get the 0% financing and failed so I returned it ad ordered it again.  had received my refund right away.  So I am happy with the phone and with the seller, BuySPRY.

When it arrived, I immediately took it to Boostmoble to see if it would work.  It was a success.  However I had to pay $35. Bucks.  My iPhone 6 memory card is not compatible with the iphone8.

  Do your homework.  When you get the phone, check the serial number (several sites online) to make sure it is not blacklisted.  Anytime you buy a renewed or used phone, you should do that. Do that before you insert the sim card and try to use the phone.Had some minor issues, at first... cleaning with spray air, cotton swabs and alcohol took care of all of them.Had to clean the lightening port, to get it to charge.The sound was not very loud.  Cleaned the ear piece slit at the top of the face, and the speaker holes at the bottom.  Shockingly, that fixed all the sound issues!  Then it was loud.  Had to turn the sound down, after... EVEN!Well worth the purchase and the value.  Be patient, work through the small issues, and it will pay off.  Would purchase one again.  (4 stars instead of 5 for the small issues.  Very happy, though)

  I purchased this unlocked iPhone 8 to replace my daughter’s iPhone 6S. It arrived on time, in great condition and exactly as described as advertised. The maximum battery capacity (viewed in Battery Health setting) showed 85% on unboxing which is expected for a phone that’s three years old. I have two boys that both have the iPhone 8 Plus and it’s consistent with their Battery Health. I put my daughter’s Verizon SIM card in the renewed iPhone 8 and haven’t had any issues. I would say this was a great purchase for the price. I could have got a similar deal from Verizon but I like the 90 day purchase warranty provided by Amazon.

  This was supposed to be an upgrade over my Samsung j2. The phone runs smooth, the camera and the speakers are a slight upgrade. However, the user interface annoys me. (this isn’t my first iPhone) The whole Bluetooth headphones is a lesser experience and finally the battery. This phone dies in 3.5 hours. It’s incredibly inconvenient and a little stressful. I think it’s just the quality the provider sold me. It says in the battery menu that the phone can only hold 69% of the maximum charge. I am for sure not giving Apple another $50 to change the battery to make it slightly better. Once again, who would pay almost $200 for a phone that dies in 3.5 hours? Very poor quality. I will gladly keep my old phone and take my money back. Update: within the first 24 hours it randomly turned off and when I turned it back on I had to reboot it to get service back.

  This phone is fantastic. My 12yr old really wanted an iPhone and we weren't going to pay Apple prices for one. It arrived in great condition and looked brand new.She has had it for around a month now, so I feel more confident leaving a review. We have had no issues with it whatsoever. Battery life could be better.The phone came with a charging cable that didn't work and seller was very quick to send a replacement out to us.  Great purchase so far.

  This has been the first time I tried buying a refurbished phone, and I was a bit nervous about, but I have been really happy about it.I received the phone, and it looks as good as new, no scrathes etc. It did not come with the original charger from apple, but that was not really a problem.I have not noticed anything not functioning, or being slightly off. Battery life seems great, I have had no technical problems with it. I also did not have any problems with connecting to my sim card and phone company, I have T-Mobile.I think it is a great way to save some money on what is already a pretty expensive phone brand, and I can recommend doing this.

  Phone is in excellent cosmetic condition with three exceptions. 1. The home button is recessed below the surface of the face plate and it isn't centered. It works but has a much different feel from my other iphone. 2. There is a large dark spot on the top right of the screen. 3 The battery life is 85% which is my reason for getting a different iphone.  The description stated Renewed (New). I suspect the screen has been replaced as well. I will be returning the phone tomorrow..

  Buyer beware! The phone arrived really looking great, almost unblemished however it started having screen issues i.e. dark screen, sadly, right after the 90 day warranty expired. I've bought this for my aging mother-in-law that lives far from me. I've had my reservations prior to purchasing it for this simple fact but I thought I'd take a chance and hope the seller would be helpful if something does happen but clearly that's not the case. So if you don't want the headache and money to burn, don't do it.

Well everyone that I tried calling could barely hear me on the other end. They stated it sounded like I was whispering despite me speaking very loudly. Don’t waste your time.

I am concerned on the long-term jostling that the phone received in transit.

Battery saves on some apps, but others it drains fast. Not sure if its the app's size, or phone's battery. Overall it works, functions, and looks just like a brand new phone.

  I purchased this phone for my daughter August 2020 the batter went dead, phone wouldn’t charge no matter what charger we used 01/01/2021. So I took it into Best Buy whom confirmed after running a diagnostic it needed a replacement batter which Was fine. I was willing to pay for the replacement batter BUT after they had open the phone up to put the replacement batter in I was SHOCKED to get a call from them that they could NOT replace the batter due to the battery currently in the phone was SUPER GLUED IN and there were missing components like screws, adhesive around the display and missing cowling. As you can see I have not had this phone for even a year and to be sold something that is just not all there and made to work for a short period of time is insulting! I have paper work and documents of Best Buy’s finding. If I can give it a negative star I would.

  I ordered the phone as a Christmas present and it arrived looking brand new. However, the sound did not work. She couldn't hear the person on the other end of the phone unless it was on speaker. I requested an exchange instead of refund. Within 2 days, I had the 2nd phone in hand and it was in pristine condition BUT it would not read her SIM card. I took the phone to AT&T thinking it was a SIM card issue. However, it was a device issue. So while in AT&T, I just chose a brand new phone to save myself the hassle of trying to get a working ""renewed"" one through Amazon. I am still waiting for my refund.

  This was a beautiful phone and a very good price. Everything worked great on it, except, unfortunately, the sound. I could hear everything just fine, but people I called said I sounded like I had my head in a bucket. I ended up returning it, so it might seem strange that I am reviewing it, but just wanted to let buyers know that the 90 day return makes it easy to take a chance on a renewed phone. No questions asked, no tricky stipulations. Just make sure you keep all your original materials and stay within the 90 days. The next phone I bought seems to be perfect, other than it isn’t that cheerful red. I did subtract one star because I think it could have been more thoroughly checked out prior to sale.

  Phone was advertised as unlocked, it was not. We had to visit our carriers store, then call customer service, only to find out there was no way they could help us. Charger that came with phone did not work at all. Phone did have quite a few scratches, and customer support wasn't able to unlock phone or provide much help. If you buy a phone here it will just waste half a day of your life, and you will end up returning it.

  I purchased this phone and after only using it for over 2 weeks it stopped charging.  It just would'nt charge.  after scrambling around the next day trying to find a phone I found a NEW phone I purchased and tried to return this one after forgetting to take the lock off they contacted me and said no refund unless I gave code.  No problem I emailed back and gave them the information, then it was something else, no refund until you do this, then the next email no refund until you do this.  I finally contacted Amazon and they took the purchase off my Amazon store card.  You cant hold peoples refunds hostage because of a defaulted product.  Thank you Amazon for the refund.

  For those of you trying to suss out which seller is best through the aggregated reviews, I ordered my from Electro Wireless. The phone took about a week to ship out, but to be fair I ordered just before the Fourth of July and I can see how that would gum up the works. It arrived within a day of being shipped though, so that made up for it.The phone looks immaculate (no scratches or dents). So far I've had no issues (though it's only been 24 hours). I booted it up, put in my sim, placed calls, sent texts, changed display settings, tested the speakers with my music, etc....anything I could really think to test I did. The phone came with the tool to open the sim tray, a USB plug, and charge cable (the plug and cable are not Apple products, which I expected, but since some reviews act surprised, I'll confirm for those of you who think that really matters).There are two minor downsides. The battery capacity is only at 89% right now. While that's still entirely useable, at 80% the battery is essentially dead/needs replaced. So I've only got 9% to use, though I'm not sure how long that will take me to run down so maybe that doesn't matter. The second downside is they also send a tempered glass screen protector, BUT, it's unfortunately the wrong size. Not sure if it's for the 8S or a newer iPhone, but it sure isn't for the regular old 8. I ordered a case anyway, so it's not really an issue for me.

  I bought this phone to replace a cheap Galaxy J3V which ran out of storage space after a few videos (16 gig vs 256 gig).  I saw the Iphone had a different size SIM than the Galaxy so I ordered a new SIM from Verizon at no cost and got it one day after I got the phone.  I charged the Iphone for several hours and started the activation.  Wouldn't activate and I talked to 4 or 5 Verizon people over two days (and long waits for a tech).  The last guy said he could see the phone and the SIM on his system but there must be something wrong with the phone, so I sent it back and said I would try another (the people at KISS were nice and got me a different phone).  Both phones were in excellent shape and the second one had a nice screen protector already installed.  Guess what?  Still wouldn't activate.  After over an hour wait on Dec 26, the Verizon tech said I needed to get a strong signal from a tower instead of a wifi signal.  This immediately made sense to me (why didn't the other Verizon techs figure this out?)  After a seven mile trip to a parking lot near a tower, the phone activated in about 15 seconds.  Amazing, right?  Not exactly.  I got back home and couldn't do anything over wifi.  The next morning I got to speak to a tech  right away but no solution.  The next level tech told me he also lived outside of cell area and used wifi and knew the problem.  Guess what, I had to go back to the tower to get a strong LTE signal to activate wifi.  The phone works fine now and I'm very happy with it.  KISS gets good marks and Verizon needs to know some people don't have cell service at their home.

  Phone came with only 86% battery health, drains very quickly. Also, the phone is from Japan. There is NO way to switch off the camera shutter sound when taking a photo on snapchat.

  Coming from a person that owned an iPhone 6 for almost 3 years, this phone is an absolute unit. I love it’s interface, the remarkable speed, and the impeccable battery life. I expected this phone to come with a scratch or two or at least an 80% battery life but it came with zero scratches and a 100% battery life. Definitely worth the purchase. It also came with a pin to manually switch over my SIM card from my old phone to this one. Fully unlocked already as well.

Its true it is unlocked, but the seller should have been more truthful and said that it is not compatible with many other carriers. So in essence it is semi-unlocked.

I do not have another phone to use and no money to wait 14 days after get the phone for a refund.

  I bought from buyspry and I could not be happier. Phone looks and responds like it’s brand new. I have a safe link SIM card and I used to have a Samsung phone. I popped in the SIM card and it worked immediately. In the box I got a charger cord and a charger box along with something to take out the SIM card tray. They may not be what you get in a regular iPhone box but it all works great. Also it did come in a generic smartphone box. I definitely do not regret this purchase. Phone absolutely looks brand new.

  The iPhone 8 I received was better Than expected. The screen had very minor scruffs under the home button that could only be seen when holding the phone at odd angles. There was also a bigger scuff in the bottom corner of the back glass but was fixed with a case. Other then those minor issues the phone was great, it came in on time, had good packaging, battery life was way better than expected, and was overall a great purchase, that I would recommend to anyone looking for a cheap Iphone.

  I purchased this device as a temporary replacement for a phone that died. In the time I used it everything functioned perfectly and other than a spot on the bezel around the charging port where the finish was worn it looked brand new. According to the built-in battery health utility it was in need of service but it lasted me all day with frequent use.All in all I would buy another without a second thought.

  I wrongly believed this iphone was defective & wrote a negative review.  Due to the corona virus our AT&T store was closed, the fact that I’d already received a horribly defective phone FROM ANOTHER COMPANY, and my total lack of knowledge about new iPhone technology all lead to this wrong conclusion.  Cellcow staff were very courteous & promptly shipped me another phone.  I want to apologize for my previous rant review.  There is nothing wrong with either phone!

No trouble operating. Needed updating to the latest iOS. The only disappointing part is the Battery Condition. These Renewed phones are guaranteed to come with batteries that have at least 80% capacity left. Mine came in at 81%. So technically its acceptable but unfortunately I will be spending another $50 soon for a new battery because it does not last under a day of light/moderate use. SO don't think you are getting a nice iPhone 8 at $177. It will cost you more like $230 when all is said and done.

  Even though I purchased a renewed phone, I can't tell it from a new one and am very impressed with quality.  I didn't rate the fingerprint reader or the face recognition because I haven't (and probably won't) use those features.  The battery life is sufficient for my activities, so it gets a 5-star rating.  I don't play games or watch videos on it so far (since I'm an old geezer, lol!), but I do have a few, favorite apps I access from time to time.  If you're not really tech savvy (like me) and can't figure out how to close the apps, just google the question and you'll find the answer.  Closing the apps saves the battery, naturally.  (I read where some were complaining about the battery life and, if they're not closing the apps, this may be the culprit.)I had an old Android before and would never go back since purchasing an iPhone.  I've read the iPhone is much more intuitive to use.  Now, I have demonstrated such to myself.The camera is quite an improvement over the one in my Android.  (The Android couldn't flip the view in order to take a selfie for one thing.)  I've taken some really beautiful, true-to-color (imo) photos with the iPhone 8--comparable to my expensive (for me) Canon Rebel AND I don't have to change lenses for closeups, lol!  Phone camera seems to take care of shake automatically, too.  I'm still learning all the features of the phone (not just the camera) and will get more proficient over time.I really, really, love my ""new"" phone and wouldn't hesitate to recommend seller or purchase from them again.  This is the first time I've purchased a used phone and was a little worried about purchasing a used/renewed phone, especially over the internet.  I had absolutely no problem activating it (cell provider even gave me a free SIM card) and no malfunctions for the two weeks (now) that I've been using the phone.  The only thing I would recommend to some reviewers/buyers (who say their phone won't charge) is the plug will fit into the phone either way.  I found out it will only charge one way, however.  So, I marked that side of the plug with a dot of magic marker and have had no problem since.  (The plug in my old phone would only fit one way, so I couldn't screw up, lol!)  Also, there's a way to put the battery indicator (life percent and charging indicator) on the front of your phone (at the upper right corner).  Just google how to do this, too.  Easy-peazy!  That way, you always know if the phone is charging (by the lightning bolt on the battery symbol) and the percentage of charge.  (I think my old Android had this feature on the front as a default.  I had to direct the iPhone to do this.  That's not a complaint.  There may be others reading this who may not know they have to do this, either, if they want it on their front screen.)

  I just received the phone, it seems to be in working order but since it is a gift it will not get set up until after Christmas, I want it noted that it is not like new, it has scratches at the upper right corner, they do not look horrible but they are noticeable and also the speaker on the top is dirty and crusty looking, it had a screen protector on it but it was not sealed on, it was taped on. I'm going to give it as the gift, but if the recipient has an issue with any of this I will be returning it.

  I've been an iPhone user for the past 13 years, and while I love the interface and design, I do not like paying the high price for a new phone. Last month, after dropping my iPhone 6 (I know I'm very behind on the models, but it still worked well!), I made the decision to upgrade. I love that I can use Amazon Renewed to find a iPhone at a fraction of the price of a new one.Many of the reviews made me nervous about making this investment because the phones they received had some problems. Since the seller Hybrid IT had great reviews, I felt better about taking the risk. (To be noted, I initially bought a iPhone 6S from Hybrid IT, but then returned it after deciding to upgrade to an iPhone 8. The return was easy and the seller was helpful!)The phone I received was in great condition, and I had no trouble setting it up with my AT&T SIM card. I've been using it for the last three weeks, and I haven't run into any issues.There are a few things to add, the phone came with a generic charging cord with a wall plug-in. It did not come with headphones, so if you are buying an iPhone 8, you'll have to buy Bluetooth headphones or Earpods with the lightning connector, which are about $29 on the Apple site. Finally, the battery health is at 84% according to my phone, which is expected with a refurbished phone. It does last me through the day, but something to note if you are in the market. I hope this helps!

  A nice IPhone with really good features and affordable. The only problem it’s some scratches on the phone and the battery health because it’s not a brand new phone, in my case I don’t have a lot of scratches but I have 84% of battery health. The seller that provide me with gifts, a case and a ceramic screen protector.I love this IPhone, it’s similar at the one I had before and have more storage than before for a lot less money. If you want a great iPhone or you are new to this, you can buy an iPhone SE 2020.But if you know what’s best for you, I highly recommend this one

  1st time I ordered one it had blown out speakers so I returned it and asked for a working one as it states that exchanges are an option. They just refunded me instead. I ordered another one. Upon opening the package I noticed that the phone was all scratched up on the bottom, but not to worry they covered the scratches with a sharpie. They are junk. They are NOT refurbished. They are scribbled on and sent out with blown speakers.

  Overall, this phone is great, just as advertised! I use StraightTalk and this phone was easy to switch over. One thing I absolutely HATE and is causing me to return the phone is the shutter sound on the camera. Everything else was as expected, but as in other reviews I see this phone might have originated from a place where the shutter sound is mandatory (see other similar reviews). I am super not a fan of this! It happens on places where the camera is used as well, like Snapchat. Made it really weird when I was taking pictures of my notes in the library. I've tried everything to get it to turn off, but I will be returning this phone and purchasing it directly through my carrier (which is what I was trying to avoid by making this purchase). Would've been PERFECT except this one feature.

The only thing that I didn’t like was It had these tiny scuffs but you could barley see it, also the battery health was 89% wanted something over 90%. Overall my phone has been just fine.

SIM Card Removal Tool3. User ManualThe cable and plug are white and wrapped in plastic just like what you would get if it was new from Apple. I cannot tell if these are originals.EarphonesHave always used 3rd party so not getting a set was not a deal breaker.Phone ConditionBody is in very good condition. There are paint flecks on the corners, maybe dropped on a hardwood floor, it is smooth to the touch, not deep so it does not appear to have been dropped on concrete, pavement or other rough surface and it is not a light scratch from carrying it in a pocket.Screen ConditionIt came with a screen protector already applied. If there are any scratches I cannot tell. With the protector on, it looks pristine.A bummer since it was not mentioned in the ad and I had purchased a case and screen protector for it. I always protect the phone before it goes outside.It’s an expensive device so why people don’t protect it from day one I’ll never know, I guess some don’t care. I have a spare screen protector now.Battery Condition <U+2028>Battery Health says 91% Maximum Capacity relative to when it was new, 86% charge on startup.Even though capacity says 91%, I am not having issues where I am out of juice early. Over a day with moderate use, heavier use I would need to recharge around 06:00pm-07:00 pm. This of course is a YMMV.Setting it upPhone was already reset. You set it up just like if it came straight out of the factory.CameraNo scratches on the lens and photos come out crisp and sharp.SpeakersNo issues, sound is very good. No hissing, cracks or pops.Microphone, Lighting PortNo issues. Works.Phone came with iOS 12.3.1 installed. So far I have not come across any issues that would give me pause on the purchase. Phone is working as expected and the ad says phone is like new and I would have to agree.<U+2028>Amazon tends to lump all the reviews together, regardless of seller so you can’t tell which negative review belongs to who. It’s as if it was all sold by one seller.  Reviewers need to say who their seller was.My seller was MobileDealz and at the time they were a little bit cheaper than most. <U+2028>This phone debut at 849.00 + tax on September 22, 2017. Nearly 2 years later it is has seen a 50%+ price drop. I don’t need the latest and greatest, a gently used phone is just as good.

  I bought the iPhone 8 256. It looked like new when I received it. It did not come in the original iPhone box. It came in a cardboard box with the plug in to charge it and the little metal piece for SIM card. It worked great in every aspect except that I noticed the sound quality was not as good as my iPhone 5s, the sound was more “tinny” sound, probably not noticeable to others, but it was for me. I don’t know if it was a defect or how the iPhone 8 was made. It just startled me when I would use it for an alarm clock playing music. I did not have any problem at all returning the iPhone. The package came with a card that had their phone number and email address, backed by Amazon. There is a 90 day warranty and I turned it back in shortly before the 90 days was up. When I spoke with the customer service, they were really nice and just wanted to know what was wrong with the iPhone. I was sent an email with the return label and I sent it back with no problem and got a full refund. Even though the phone did not work out for me, I would still recommend this company because of their great service and following through with what they say they will do.

  iPhone came locked. We took it to T-Mobile who couldn’t do anything for us. We then took it to Apple, who offered to bypass the code. As they were working to bypass, the phone wouldn’t connect to the USB port. The Apple genius takes out a cleaner and starts unpacking gunk from the charging port. So, that was the moment I decided that we were sending this back. It was locked, it was packed with lint, it would not charge, and it has a visible scratch. So much for careful refurbishing.

  The phone came in great condition but I have one small problem. I had an android from metropcs before this iphone and I tried putting the Sim in this phone but it says ""no sim"" and wont make calls. I saw another review on here that said it works with metro pcs so I'm trying to figure out the problem.

    Works Great But Here's A Tip For Straight Talk Users
  
","









  
  
    
  Have only had the phone a couple of days but so far it works great.  It is an iPhone 8, 64GB model.  It looks brand new and everything functions as it should.  A note to Straight Talk users.  That is my carrier and when I put my Straight Talk SIM card in this phone it works great but I went to the Straight Talk website and logged in so I could transfer my new phone and register it.  The website kept giving me an error when I entered the phone's IMEI or serial number so I called Straight Talk support.After working with me for a while, the rep said ""You can't use your current SIM card because you have an unlocked phone.  You are going to have to buy a new SIM card and then register that and the new phone with our ""Bring Your Own Phone"" system on the website.""  I asked if I did that could I keep my phone number and he said yes.  I did some research online and got the impression the the Bring Your Own Phone is not for existing customers, but for new customers or existing customers with new phones who want new phone numbers.  Not sure about that, but my thought is that since the phone works perfect as it is, I am not going to try to upset the apple cart by buying a new SIM and trying to register it with Straight Talk.  I think they don't want us users to have unlocked phones and especially ones that were not purchased through the Straight Talk website or an authorized supplier so I am leaving well enough alone.  The phone works fine with my SIM card, the only thing is that on the Straight talk website it shows I have a Samsung Galaxy instead of an iPhone 8.  No harm, no foul.

El caso es que el telefono tiene solo 4 meses en las manos de mi hija y se bloquea todo el tiempo, se pone en blanco la pantalla, se agrandan los numeros, no funciona el touch screen, una verdadera estafa.

  Leason learned with this one.  I received the phone a couple weeks ago, but waited for my daughter to get home from college for Christmas before activating it.  After she activated it, she was having problems sending messages, etc., so she went to the Verizon store for help.  She was told the serial number for the phone is blacklisted because it has been reported lost or stolen.  When we tried to re-active her old phone, her number had been blocked for fraud associated with the stolen/lost phone.  She and my husband were on the phone with Verizon last night for more than two hours trying to get this mess resolved.  Don't do it.  It's not worth it.  Just get a new phone.

  The camera doesn’t work, neither does the flash light. This has been a problem since unpacking the item. Eventually, both would work after resetting and restoring my iPhone but would then stop after a few days.I have dealt with this issue for over a month. Initially, I tried calling the seller multiple times and have left a voice message. Never heard from them. So I am now stuck with a faulty phone that works on its own terms.The seller was Lonestar Mobile.

  Despite the basic packaging, I was quite impressed with the condition of the phone, it looked brand new without a single scratch, which was one of my main concerns, when purchasing a refurbished phone. It also came with nicely packaged; headphones, aux adapter cable, and a charger. What I like the most about this purchase, was the fact that it was SIM unlocked(read some reviews saying it wasn’t). I was able to insert my AT&T SIM card and have it work immediately without any complications, I was able to call/text people within minutes of activating the phone. I’ve only had this phone for a week now and so far nothing seems to raise any red flags yet, I’ll update my review if anything changes.

  I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised).I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8  in 5 minutes tops.  I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7.  It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge.I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!

  I almost returned it after I couldn’t get it to read my SIM card. But after multiple attempts, a tiny piece of metal fell out onto my lap and I attempted once more to insert my SIM card into the phone and it slid right in, where as before it must’ve been being blocked by that tiny piece of metal, and the compartment that holds the SIM card wasn’t being inserted all the way and was actually protruding out of the phone, but it wasn’t that noticeable until i compared it both mine and my sisters iPhone, and those were both flush with the phone. I’m extremely happy with my purchase after that issue was resolved. I ordered the silver case, its white on the back side not silver, but I still like it. With a case on all u can see is the silver Apple and I guess the white makes it stand out, otherwise it doesn’t seem like it would. The circle around the home button is silver though. This may be what they consider silver<U+0001F937><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>. Regardless I’m happy with everything, works and looks like a brand new phone.

  The phone was beautiful and perfect in great condition! However, the shutter sound would not mute, which meant it was probably from Japan where it is illegal to mute the camera shutter sound. You can't even turn it down. There was NOTHING I could do to mute the sound. I tried everything, even running it on another app. I returned the phone...I was sad because it was perfect. If you don't mind the sound, you should but it...be beware!

It could only hold a charge for a few hours so I had to have it replaced at the Apple store.Within just a few minutes of me leaving my original feedback  the company that sold it to me (Hybrid IT) called me directly and offered to pay for the battery replacement (which they did).Just simply wow! In less than 10 minutes they called me and made it right.If you want one of these phones I highly recommend you choose the vendor Hybrid IT for it.

  Bought two iPhones from these guys. I'm barely past the warranty period and one of the iPhones consistently shuts off when it gets a little warm. We only noticed recently because the person I gifted the phone to didn't start using it until one month ago. It took a month to really notice the problem. I called and explained the situation to these guys, and they couldn't get me off the phone fast enough. Since we were out of warranty, they just said ""nope, no exceptions."" I understand that technically they don't have to work with us to solve the problem, but seriously, in this day and age, great companies who care about customer service will be reasonable and help find a solution. I'm even willing to pay a little for them to swap out phones, but they were completely dismissive and rude to me on the phone and 100% unwilling to help. I'd recommend taking your chances buying a phone with another company. If you ever run into any problem, these guys clearly have zero interest in doing the right thing. Very disappointing.

  Ordered the gold tone (it's more like rose gold but that is what I expected/wanted) Iphone 8 on Thursday afternoon and was notified just a few hours later that it had shipped.  It arrived on Monday (regular mail).  It looks BRAND NEW, not a scratch on it anywhere.  Took it to local carrier to switch service from previous phone to them and everything has worked perfectly since then.There's been a bit of fun learning curve as this phone is much more advanced than my previous (slider) but I figured it was time to get closer to the age of 2021 technology.  No owners booklet came with it but any info needed can easily be googled.I could have purchased this same phone from a cell phone repair shop in town but this one was $80 cheaper and with the generous 90 day return policy, there was no doubt in my mind that this phone was the one to go with.I am quite pleased with it!BTW--KEEP THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING ETC, JUST IN CASE YOU HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE PHONE.  YOU HAVE A 90 DAY RETURN WINDOW IN CASE SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE PHONE.

Those places do not allow you to turn off your camera shutter sound whether your phone is on silent with the media all the way down, or you’re using a third party camera. It always makes that super awkward and annoying shutter sound

  I saw multiple reviews talking about how these refurbished phones were horrible and I was skeptical at first but I am glad I took the plunge and purchased this used phone. It is pretty much like new and was shipped clean and ready for setup. No issues with it thus far and battery life seems appropriate. I will certainly do business with this seller again

  Phone arrived and works, but the battery health is 86%. Unacceptable. Now you're asking the customer to take apart their phone either now or in the next month or so to replace something that should have been taken care of. You're assuming the customers have odd screw drivers like tri-wings. You're assuming the customer can replace the waterproofing measures on this phone just to replace a battery. From now on, you do it. Not Okay.

  I’m a Verizon Prepaid customer and wanted to upgrade phones. I had a little trouble trying to use eBay, so I came to amazon and this was by far the best experience I had with ordering this phone. It came the next day after I ordered it and I only needed to put my SIM card from my iPhone 6 into the new iPhone 8 and it connected right to the network. I didn’t have to go in the store or call a number or anything. Wonderful phone upgrade. It’s much better than the old one. Would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade a Verizon prepaid phone.

  Yes the shutter sound can’t be turned off but by just using Live mode to take photos that is resolved. The phone was for my wife and she likes the shutter sound (who knows why?) so zero problem either way. Phone arrived indistinguishable from new. Shiny and scratch free. Setup was easy. SIM card from old phone worked perfectly. Charged extremely fast and battery seems to last a long time. We added the extended warranty. A 256GB phone for less than $300 can’t be beat.

  I don’t always write reviews but I’m so happy with the condition of the iPhone I got, no visible scratches or dents. I get all my calls and text messages I just put my old at&t SIM card in and it works perfectly. Only downside is battery maximum capacity is 83%. But I feel that is fair enough because the product description says >80% which it is. Don’t buy one of these if you need a better battery life.

  I used the phone with AT&T for about nine months. It worked well. When I asked AT&T to unlock the phone so I could use it with another carrier, AT&T had no record of the phone I received from this seller. Thus, unless I use this phone is used only with AT&T, the phone is useless going forward.Phones advertised as AT&T carrier phones should fall under the general rules and conditions of what it means to have phones locked to that carrier. AT&T can unlock phones that are originally locked to them. Apparently, mine works with AT&T (described as ""partially unlocked"" by AT&T reps) but cannot be unlocked unless the original carrier is identified. This seller said it's AT&T; AT&T says it's not AT&T.Should it really fall to me, the consumer, who believes ""Apple iPhone 8, 64GB, Gold - For AT&T"" means the phone is registered to AT&T -- to resolve this issue? A consumer can't unlock a phone. Only a carrier can.

  So I ordered the iPhone in gold,64 gb, fully unlocked. But what had came was the iPhone in black but totally unlocked, I made sure I ordered the gold one. Only a few bad things battery health was at 96 when I first got it and just realized only one of the speakers works, the left one does not work. But in general the phone is good

  This is the second refurbished iPhone that I purchased from Hybrid IT on Amazon. I purchased from Hybrid IT because of their excellent customer satisfaction rating. I bought the iPhone 8 as a birthday gift for my granddaughter and she loved it. The phone arrived on time, was well packaged and in perfect condition. It looked like new, not a scratch on it. It worked perfectly and when the SIM card was added, was set up on a cell phone plan with no issues. The battery health was 90% which is great for a refurbished phone.

    Japanese market iPhones received, can't disable camera shutter sound

  I ordered 2 iPhone 8's from this vendor at a good price.The phones I received work well, but after using them a while we discovered that we were unable to disable the rather loud camera shutter sound.  This is apparently a ""feature"" of Japanese market iPhones due to local laws.  Sure enough, when we find the Model code in the settings, these are Japanese models, even though we are in the U.S.There was no indication that we would receive foreign model phones in the listing, nor how they may differ from US distributed phones.  The listing indicates that the phones are ""For AT&T"", which I believe is a U.S. only network provider.This is somewhat annoying.

  I've had a great experience purchasing from this seller. I had to return the phone because of some rear camera issues, but the seller was fully cooperative and very helpful. Therefore, although I had to spend time on the setting-up of the phone (and the subsequent erasure of my data), the stress was mitigated by the responsiveness of the seller and their willingness to replace the item with a fully satisfying phone. I'll definitely work with the seller again. I am assured that if there's anything wrong with the phone, the seller will make sure to replace it with an item that is satisfactory and without any defect.

  Renewed iPhone is great. The charger however, a thin black plastic replacement. I travel. Unlike the Apple charger, this plug portion cannot be replaced w an alternate country's plug. It also fits too loosely in the wall. Had to use a floor strip to keep it plugged. I know accessories can be replacements, but they have to have same function/capabilities. Hoping I can get a comparable one sent by the seller. Amazon responded quickly to the complaint, however, and gave me a credit for a future purchase.

ATT could not unlock because they found out that the phone had not bee paid off by the party who sold or traded it to the seller of this product.  Will not buy from this seller AGAIN!

  These are not “arm length” good as advertised. I hardly count a chip in the expensive back glass as acceptable. Ordered another one and due to weather it’s been stuck in transit for a week now. Hopefully the next one arrives unharmed and here before the 28th, otherwise I’m returning both.

Be sure you check which phone you are getting because some did not say fully unlocked. I ordered the silver and all i did was switch my SIM card over and everything was there.

  I got this with international shipping to South Africa, the packaging seemed really secured. And still, I received a half cracked home button on this phone.

The post clearly stated that the phone was “Professionally inspected, tested, and cleaned to work and look like new.”. I provided some images but my old phone doesn’t have the best camera quality. If you’re looking for a seller who keeps their promises, this is not the place to purchase from. I don’t recommend at all!

  I had to get a new battery for this phone becaue it would not stay on. The phone was out of warrany and I do not expect the seller to repair this becaue I did not purchase the extended warranty. When I took the phone to get a new battery they siad its missing parts and the battery is just flopping around. It had one screw holding the internal parts in. The company said they will not work on it because it was so badly refrubished that I will have continual issues with it. I contacted the seller to try and reslove the issue but they have not contaced me back. I am stuck with a dead phone that is useless. AVOID THIS SELLER!!!

  I've had good and bad luck buying refurbs. In this case it appears the phone came with a bad battery. After a day it was dead. I would hope the refurb process included a new battery. One could waste a lot of time setting up a new phone, then going back to the old. A chance you take.

  This phone is only worth the $170 I paid for it. Meaning, you get what you pay for. The speaker for both input and output are horrible, no one can hear me and I can’t hear them. Also drops calls repeatedly. Will be returning if possible. Oh and battery health is only 83%, it seems to be holding a charge fine but 83% health is pretty bad. Amazon needs to do a little more testing before they start sending out these refurbished phones.

  Overall, this phone has been exactly what I expected.  Everything functions well.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the screen had a few minor scratches  and the battery maximum capacity only reaches 82%.  I know these are all things within the expectations of a refurbished phone, but for the hundreds of dollars I spent, it's still a little disappointing hence 4 stars not 5.  Overall, though, I'm very satisfied.

  Phone arrived on time, and looked completely new.  Was easy to set up and worked exactly as expected.  After two weeks, if I was out and was carrying the phone in a bag it would begin to randomly execute functions.  Initially I thought I had been hacked, but I read on line that this probably means the screen installation is faulty.  Unfortunately this happened  while I was on vacation, so I ended up being without a cell phone during my trip whenever I was out of the house.  It also deleted all my music (which I was able to re load when I returned home).  It then took another week to call and obtain the postage paid label and buy a replacement phone once I returned home, so I was without a mobile phone for several weeks.  I have bought refurbished phones in the past without any problem.  I intend to try again to buy a refurbished phone as it is the phone I want, it did look perfect, the battery life seems good, and the price is very good.

  I specifically sought this US-based model number A1863: it is listed as such.  Awesome.  I instead received a Japanese version model A1902 (apple p/n MQ782J/A).  Did you know that the Japanese model doesn't allow the user to silence the shutter sound effect when taking pictures, or the beeps when starting or stopping video recording?  After some embarrassment in front of clients at job site surveys, I researched the model number and learned why it was happening.  I ended up downloading a non-Apple camera app, in order to avoid the sound effects.  If I was sent the A1863 model as listed, this issue would not have cropped up.  That is why I am taking off one star from this review.To the seller's credit, the phone arrived a day early, was packaged well, and was in excellent physical shape.  All I had to do was put my SIM card in it, and load in everything from my iTunes account.  I've had it for several weeks, with no hiccups.AppleCare coverage was obviously expired and the battery reported its maximum health as 88%, but this is obviously a used phone.  Still a good value for me.

  This is my third week with this phone. Its perfect but there’s a tiny few problems. First of all what I hate with a passion is the camera shutter sound which I tried everything I possibly could to turn it off but nothing at all worked. Then after some researched I learnt that all iphones from Japan are like this because it’s illegal to take photos in public on silent. Last thing is the battery life. It came with 97% capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some YouTube videos I think its just how iPhone 8s are because of all these running apps and stuff so I did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot. So I don’t know if that’s how the iPhone 8s are. And also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllll<U+0001F60D>. Mine came a with 0 scratches very neat with the charger( not original but its still very good) all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there’s a 30 day or i think three months free return. And also I wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn’t work so I currently use h2o wireless which is bum a**. Hope this review helped its <U+0001F4AF> percent honest.Edit- you can fix the camera sound by downloading apps such as Microsoft Pix which allows you to turn off camera shutter sounds, other than that you’ll have to jailbreak your phone.

  I was impressed with the phone.  The battery lifespan on the phone when I got it says 90%.  Not bad at all!  No scratches, no dents, looked pretty much new.  Saved hundreds and now I have the phone I wanted with 256gb to download anything under the sun which is why I replaced my old phone that only had 18gb.  My work would only allow us to get the 18gb iPhone which really annoyed me but I understood why.  So I took it upon myself when the battery started going to get my own phone & just pay for it myself.  We use AT&T as a provider at my work, so all I needed to do was take out the SIM card from my old iPhone and put it in this 256gb beast....I’m so happy I did.  So far so good.  I recommend this seller for sure. Great product! I will update this review down the line if I end up having any problems out of the ordinary.  Hope this review helps as I was very skeptical in buying used and saw some reviews that aided me in making this purchase.  Also, I purchased using my Amazon credit card which allows you to make 12 monthly payments around $30/month at 0% interest.  I can’t lose!!!  That’s the cost of 10 coffees at Starbucks a month.  I’ll enjoy my own brew for a year to offset the costs.  Okay, I’m done.  Now I just sound like a bag of hot air.

  Upon opening the box there is a packet of information with ""Open me first"" on it.  If you do that the set up is flawless.  Once you turn on your new/used iphone and enable bluetooth and set it next to your old iphone it pretty much transfers all your settings, address book and apps in a matter of minutes, it could not have been any easier. You then use the tool provided and put your sim card in and it's ready to use. On the renewed premium phones the battery health is supposed to be at least 90% or better, to my surprise it's at 100%.  The iphone itself looks like it's a new phone, not a scratch on it, it even has a month or so left on the original Apple warranty from whoever owned it before.  I've been wringing it out, texting, taking pics, making calls and using all of the new features this has to offer that my old iphone 6 plus didn't have and so far so good.  While I liked the bigger screen on the 6 plus I could never get used to the size and wanted a smaller profile with more processing power and this fits the bill for me.  I don't know if all renewed premium phones are like the one I got but I'm really impressed, better yet I have a full year to put it through it's paces.  I wanted to upgrade to a newer faster model iphone without breaking the bank.  My hats off to Amazon and the tech., MM in New Jersey that tested and signed off on the 20 point inspection certificate, nice job on an outstanding phone.

    COMPANY LIED IN THEIR ADVERTISING - PHONE WAS NOT FOR VERIZON AS ADVERTISED!!

  (I bought this for my son to be placed on my current VERIZON network plan) ...so..ok, let me start by saying that i received the phone via 2-day Prime shipping. Phone came in a generic box, but sufficient for transport. It included the charger and 3ft charging cable. nothing else. Unboxed, the phone was in EXCELLENT cosmetic condition, not a single scratch anywhere. I powered it on, the display was beautiful and worked as it should. At that point I ran thru the setup and got the phone all setup for my son (its his b-day present) ... then I took the phone to VERIZON STORE and had them put a VERIZON SIM in it for activation and to be added to my current verizon plan ....WELL GUESS WHAT... this phone is a model A1905, and it is ONLY GSM carrier compatible, NOT CDMA, which is what verizon is.... but yet, this phone was advertised as "" FOR VERIZON"" , which is the ONLY reason I went ahead and bought it. The Verizon models are A1863 & A1864. So I have given the review 2 stars because of the great cosmetic, great camera and fully functional condition , but because they LIED, and DID NOT send me what I purchased (a phone for VERIZON networks), I do feel that this is unacceptable that tey are allowed to Advertise one thing, then send you another. Where I come from we call that a big fat LIE!!! and I DO NOT put up with LIARS, therefore I  reporting themfor FALSE ADVERTISEMENT and hopefully they will be kicked off of AMAZON

  The camera sound (the “click” when you take a picture) cannot be muted, not even if you switch off the sound with the button on the left side and you activate the Silent Mode. I went to the Apple store to verify if it was a hardware issue and it could be repaired, but they said no: they informed me that this is not adjustable as the phone comes from Japan and this is one of those countries where the sound of the camera cannot be silenced. I found it extremely disappointing, as I would have never bought it if I knew in advance – and I am very surprised that this is an Amazon “certified and inspected product”: did not you realize while inspecting the phone that the camera sound could not be muted? At least you could have advised that in this particular device the sound could not be turned off.As a loyal customer of Amazon (Prime too) from several years now, I found it extremely shady: you sponsor a product as certified and tested by Amazon-qualified supplier and you should be transparent while describing the product and its specifications, given that Amazon is an international platform and your buyers are based all around the world. I am based in the USA and knowing that the product would have come from Japan and the camera cannot be silenced, I wouldn’t have completed the purchase but switched to a different supplier.This is a lack of primary information that should have been disclosed by Amazon and would have guided and helped me in the purchasing process.Lastly, the battery is weak – it lowers down very quickly and I have to charge it at least three times a day.

  UPDATE:  After I returned the first iPhone, I ordered a second one.  The second one came very quickly as well.  This one came with 81% battery capacity and much less pitting and wear than the 1st one.  Since these are used phones, I guess it really just depends on the luck of the draw.  I did notice the price increased a few dollars when I purchased the second one, so maybe there's something there? Anyways, adjusted my review from 2 to 4 stars.  The second phone deserves 5 stars, but since I had to go through the process of returning the 1st one, which forced me to switch phones 2 weeks later than I would've liked, I say 4 stars is fair.ORIGINAL:To note: I am obviously returning this product, but will give time for the seller to make things right.  I will change/delete my review if the seller can remedy the situation.To the seller's credit, this phone was delivered much faster than expected, almost a week early.  However, what good is a phone that arrives early if it isn't as advertised.  One of the only guarantees this product comes with is that the battery capacity will exceed 80%.  That's directly from the description from the listing.  Imagine my disappointment when I go to settings and see the message ""Your battery's health is significantly degraded..."" ""Maximum Capacity: 76%"".  This is worse than the iPhone 8 I currently have and was trying to ""upgrade"", and keep in mind I had my current iPhone 8 for about 4 years now.  Completely unacceptable.If even after all that, you still decide to purchase one of these, I should also mention, if you look close enough, you can tell you bought a used phone.  This isn't to knock the seller or the product, it's clear you're not getting a new product, just shows minor signs of wear and tear.

  I’ve been using this phone for 3 weeks. Calls are so quiet that unless you’re in silent a silent room you can’t hear the call even with the volume turned all the way up. The keyboard occasionally doesn’t pop up- you have to turn the phone off and back on to get the keyboard working, made worse by the fact that it’ll only turn on after being turned off if it’s connected to power even if it’s fully charged. And there’s an annoying feedback noise on the playback of videos made using the front facing camera.So calls, text, and camera are bad. Hopefully Amazon honors the 90 day guarantee because I won’t be able to return it until next week and when I tried to return it to the seller it said that had to return it by tomorrow.

  The touch screen of the mobile phone is not sensitive, especially in the four corners. It takes many times to press it to get a response. The sound of the microphone and receiver sometimes is very small, and sometimes it is difficult for the other party to hear clearly when making a call. Sometimes works, so this phone is not stable. Battery easy run off. Probably will return it.

I ultimately traded in my phone at the Apple store for $220 trade in value and got a new 8 plus instead. It sucks because I paid $370 for the phone and had it for less than a min so I was out $150.

I had a rough beginning with the phone but the company was so understanding and fixed my problem. The phone was in great condition when I received it!

  Everything about the phone is fine. The one thing I needed most was being able to make better phone calls and that's what's wrong with it. The microphone is all static and makes it super hard to hear my voice. I need that part for my job and I'm out of money to spend on another one. Going to have to go get that part fixed. But everything else is pretty good. Nothing seems to be wrong with it besides that.

I also like the water Proof it has.

  I bought this phone unlocked to use in another country! I had no problems buying and activating a SIM card and it works great! The only problem I have is that there was a scratch on it that was partially covered up with a glass cover. I didn’t like the attempt to hide this. I do not live in the US and can’t easily exchange it and I needed a phone for international use. Other than that the phone works great and I am happy with my purchase!

I contacted the company again and they replied but are refusing at the very least a return, suggesting I take it to a ""repair shop"" and have them look at it. It freezes constantly and the volume doesn't work most of the time and at random times every day it makes a loud beeping sound and goes black for about a minute. I'm very disappointed in the whole situation.

  This quit working completely within 4 months.  The battery health was under 80%.  The earpiece speaker was blown and just overall not in the condition they claimed it was in.  The phone now no longer works and when we took it to have it looked at the screws were completely stripped and it could not be opened without destroying the screen to fix it.  It no longer turns on due to a manufacturing defect with these phones and should have been checked with Apple before it was sold.

So now I’m going through the process of returning the phone and I’ll write again on my experience with this process. Kinda just wanted a exchange but on returning it they say only refunds. FYI, I’m not phone stupid I  did All the steps to fix the issue and it wasn’t something silly from a option on the phone with the volume.

The battery life is not that great I mean I have an iPhone 6 and that battery lasted a long time this one dies after a few hours. But what I paid for it I guess it’s what you should expect. Better than no phone at all lol

  This product came in good shape but with a completely bad battery. The phone would work until you got to around 50% and the. Would randomly shut off! I had to buy a battery 1 day after I received it and it cost me another $70.00... I bought the 2 year warrant and paid an extra $70.00 for that! I use my phone for business and don’t have time to send it in for warranty so I just paid outta pocket to prevent the inconvenience. I am always worried about buying used things online for this exact reason. With that said the phone works perfect after the new battery was installed. I will be very reluctant to buy used electronics online in the future. (Which was my gut feeling in the first place!!)

  Based on reviews I've read, it seems that refurbished phones are hit and miss. And that makes sense: not all used phones were treated equally.Our experience with this Renewed iPhone 8 has been GREAT.  The phone really is in excellent condition. Works like new, looks almost new, but costs half the price. Battery came with 93% battery life, which is still an 'A' in my book.I'd recommend giving it a try. We are very satisfied with the phone.

  So far I’m happy with my new iPhone 8, with one exception: it came with a non-compatible charger. How am I supposed to charge up a brand new phone with the wrong charger? Good thing I had my existing iPhone 6 charger. My point is, if they say they’re going to send you a compatible charger, then send one! Then I found out the hard way that my Sim card in my iPhone 6 is not compatible with my iPhone 8, and this phone did not come with a Sim card. I suggest you read the product description thoroughly before you decide to purchase!

Nothing wrong with the phone software wise, but there do seem to he quite a grea amount of scratches on the screen itself that are pretty shallow but still a lot for a renewed phone, you dont really notice them but i hope no one else gets a somewhat marked up phone like i did, besides that i love the phone and recommend this product if you need a cheap alternative to a pretty relevant iphone in 2020. HIGHLY RECOMMEND

  So far, so good.  The setting was easy and smooth.  It copied my contacts, photos, etc. from my other cell phone.  Now I have two phones with different numbers but the same settings/contents. It labels each as phone as iphone1and iphone2. TMobile is my cell provider.  I have been looking for a cell phone that can accommodate 2 numbers. The last time I checked, I was told that kind of phone doesn't exist (yet!).  I don't know if that is even possible. However, with today's technology, nothing is impossible. Happy to have extra cell phones that I use for my business plus another iphone that I used for personal.

  It’s a great phone for a great price.  My o ly issue is that it was originally intended for sale in a country where you can’t silence the camera click noise.  Not a huge deal but it confused me for a while :/The battery life is excellent and the fingerprint is perfect - those were the two things that had gone wrong on my old iPhone 6 so I’m happy to have those functions back!

  The iPhone came in nearly perfect condition, only flaw was a tiny scratch near the speakers at the bottom. It had no issues at all running iOS 14, everything runs so smoothly and I was very impressed. I got this phone as a gift for my girlfriend as her first iPhone and it does very well to keep up with my iPhone XR at times, plus we got another iPhone 8 for her mother a few weeks after with no physical flaws at all. I couldn’t find face recognition but the fingerprint scanner on both phones work as intended. The battery can last a good work day, about 9-10 hours. Definitely worth checking out for the price!

  I purchased this phone from BuySPRY.  The phone works great, EXCEPT you cannot turn off the sound of the camera shutter.  It is a Japanese model.  In Japan, there is a law that phones must make a sound when taking a photo.  The sound does not play when taking a live photo, but in any app that uses the camera, it will make a sound when taking a still photo even if it is muted.  Quite annoying if you are trying to take a photo of something in a quiet room.

  Very nice phone, came almost brand new. It has a very small scratch on the screen but I can’t even tell it’s there. No scratches on back or anywhere else. It was fully unlocked and works well with my service. (Cricket Wireless) I upgraded from a 6S and my only complaint is the battery life not being much better than the 6s. However I know batteries tend to die down with age. The phone does charge pretty fast, came with its own charger, and it works perfectly. Would buy it again

  Shipping was super fast, arriving a day early. The phone was in good condition, as described. There is an area of scratches on the screen, but it’s in the top right and not on the actual touchscreen area; with a screen protector they’re not even viable. Everything works perfectly so far, and battery life is superior to my previous phone’s battery that was only about a year old.I was absolutely thrilled to find they included a screen protector in the box. I don’t remember seeing that mentioned in what was included, but it absolutely made my day since it meant I didn’t have to run out to get one or order one and wait for it to arrive. That little bit of thoughtfulness on the seller’s part completely won me over on the whole transaction, and really impressed me.

  This phone is great. We are on fixed incomes and didn't want to spend an outrageous amount of money to upgrade from our iPhone 6. So, we purchased this refurbished phone from Amazon and have been very pleased. The phone, although used, looks absolutely brand new and operates like a new phone as well. We were so pleased with the phone I got, that my husband bought a similar one from Amazon just last week. Thank you for making options like this available for people who don't need, want, or can afford the latest and greatest gadgets.

  This is going to be an accurate, unbiased review of the phone, so hear me out.The phone's that are received by each person will most definitely be different. My experience went as follows.Upon receiving the phone the right side of the screen was popping up a little, and if it was pushed down into the phone it would cause a blemish to appear in the middle of the phone. No biggie, I just need it to perform basic actions and not die. Here's where the second issue comes in to play. Upon receiving the phone the battery was already at 70% integrity. After the 90-day warranty that integrity was below 50, and now my phone has turned off and refuses to charge. I still have my old phone so this isn't too much of an issue, however now I'm out 240+ dollars and an iPhone.I realize beggars can't be choosers, but you're honestly much better off getting a refurbished phone from a store.

I got the amazon certified renewed phone, didn't have any problems with sound quality, my screen was in great condition - no cracks, came with a protector on it. Phone worked great. I returned it within 30 days as I changed my mind dropping $$ on this but it was pretty nice, and not a bad experience with amazon certified refurbished at all.

   I purchased this for my son (high school student), and he hadn’t used the phone camera from the beginning. After a while, he started to use it, then realized the camera couldn’t work. The screen kept on dithering while taking photos or videos, couldn’t focus. We tried many ways to solve this problem, unfortunately when we reached to the seller, it’s already passed 90 days, they chose to ignore my request for help. We couldn’t get any solution, very disappointing.

  The sim card tray was extremely hard to get out.  Then I realized my phone came in with 84% battery life.  I didn’t realize that a battery should be replaced at 80 percent.  Had I realized, I would have passed on this seller.  Refurbished is one thing.  Bad battery life is another.  They were pretty arrogant in their email.  So BEWARE!  Your phone could come almost needed a replaced battery.My sister bought a refurbished phone from Amazon from another seller for around the same price and her battery life is 98%.  So I’d recommend shopping around!

  So glad I trusted the positive comments for the seller BuySPRY! My iphone 8 looked like brand new and has been working great! Even came with a durable screen protector! The generic lightning cable and power brick look and perform just like authentic products. What a great way for me to get an iPhone for work without having to spend the $$ for the newest model. For $199, I now have an iphone for work so that I can check email and calendar. I still use my Android, but my work only allows iPhones for exchange access due to Apple's stringent security updates. Battery life is great. All in all, exceeds my expectations so far!

  I upgraded from an iphone 6, to an iphone 8 after the announcement of the iphone 11 price drop, because with ios13 they finally stopped supporting the 6. All I do on my phone is check email, chat on telegram, take photos and watch youtube. I'm not a power user, so the main difference I noticed was everything became more responsive, faster, and the battery lasts much longer. The transfer process was pretty easy through itunes. No complaints, I stuck with apple out of sheer convenience, and I'll probably continue to stay with apple as long as they don't remove the fingerprint reader in future models.

  I purchased this iPhone 8 (with the Renewed Premium Guarantee) for my daughter.  It arrived in excellent condition.  However, the first day she had it, the phone would crash and restart when the battery reached about 40%.  This happened again over the next couple days.  I went into the battery settings (see attached screen shot) and found that the battery was seriously degraded, even though it was supposed to be in ""similar to new"" condition with a guaranteed capacity of at least 90%.  So I called Amazon Customer Support for a replacement phone.  It was a cumbersome process.  The Amazon representative had to contact Apple, and he and I were on hold with Apple for about 20 minutes.  When the Apple representative got on the line, the Amazon rep left the call.  The Apple rep remotely ran battery diagnostics and confirmed that the battery was failing.  She then told me the phone was out of warranty and wanted to quote out-of-warranty pricing to me for a new battery.  I objected, stating that Amazon was guaranteeing this phone for a year and wondering why I had to pay for anything at this point.  She then had to talk with her manager, and again I was on hold for several minutes.  She came back and said that I would have to talk with Amazon about the phone.  So I took the case number she gave and called Amazon back.  I was on hold again for a few minutes with Amazon, but when the customer service rep came on the line, I explained the scenario and she took care of the replacement immediately.  I received the new phone the next day.  It arrived in excellent condition and thus far seems to be working perfectly.  Everyone I talked to, both at Amazon and at Apple, was very nice and easy to deal with, it just took a lot of my time to resolve the problem.  All told, I was on the phone for about an hour and five minutes just to get the phone replaced.  I am satisfied with the replacement, I just wish the process would have taken less time.

  My son save his Christmas money and ordered this phone- Now after a 3 Hour ordeal, first with amazon support via the number provided in this posting who could not fix the issue Amazon linked in Apple support who couldn't fix and brought on a senior apple support tech who could not fix the issue either -they indicated it was probably a hardware issue, called Amazon back and they said sorry this is not their problem even though it says Amazon guarantee. They finally agreed that they would email the vendor - that was the extent of their HELP and Backing. Caution on ordering items listed as Amazon Backed- doesn't mean much. Not sure why they say ""Product works and looks like new. Backed by the 90-day Amazon Renewed Guarantee."" if they don't really mean it.#Frustrated

  Bought this renewal product as a gift. It came in 2 days (Nov 16 to Nov 18) but item is not as the description. It was advertised as battery exceed 80% (This product will have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new) but it was exactly at 80% which means I have to replace a new battery eventually which costs another $80-$100. The screen freezes off a lot of time and one one point, only the home button works. I have to do hard reset to make it coming back to usual. Trying to call customer services but no one available, emailing them is no help. I regret to buy this. Now I have to take time to return plus I need to find a different one in 2 days.

  So, many negative reviews describe issues with phone, scratches, battery life, etc.I took a risk as the price was decent for a newer mode 64 GB phone to upgrade my older 16 GB one.Yes, mine came with a battery life of 87, but that was WAY better than my old iphone.Came in a simple box with off brand but working charging block and wire, with SIM card push pin.At the moment (about a week), I can say the phone looks and works AMAZING.Looks brand new, works smooth, updated to iOS 14 with no issues.The negative reviews here seem legit, but my experience was great, and for the price of <$300, felt it was worth the risk and Amazon has a good return policy.I am SUPER happy with purchase, and encourage people to weigh the risks, and order with plan to return if it isn’t ideal, but know that I LOVE my new phone.

  Even tho i had to return i must give high marks to seller.  Kiss electronics for a incredibly nice refurbished phone. Think it was just a problem i was having on my end. Read up on it a bit kinda of a common problem but others seemed to fix with updates. My issue was only getting 1 bar and dropping calls, everywhere i went. I live in Houston TX. Not lacking cell tower power.  At&t account for well over 20+ years. Ive seen a few phones. Tryed updates but couldn't get them to finish. Tryed at&t my account is probably older then the kids in there and they seemed to have the mindset that it wasnt there phone so not there problem unless i was ready to drop alot of cash. So no problem at all with seller or amazon on this. On home wifi it was perfectly fine phone if i could have gotten some reasonable help from At&t probably would have gotten it sorted out

  I literally bought this phone in august for nearly $400 and it would randomly shut off and i didn’t think anything of it, but after the 14.3 update it revealed that I have broken hardware. For 400 dollars I was definitely expecting a phone with zero issues I’m going into the Apple store to hopefully get it fixed tomorrow, if they can’t fix it I’m hoping I can return it.

  The phone arrived not charged and after 30 minutes of charging had 3% life and nothing would work on the phone.  After getting in-person help from my carrier Cricket, they confirmed that it doesn't work and i need to return it.  Unfortunately , then I had to pay $6 to return it because Amazon requests you print the label and box yourself.

  I was skeptical about ordering a phone from this company went my daughter phone broke.  But I took a chance.  Once I received it I called Verizon and it was easy to set up, no problems and $150 cheaper than buying from Verizon directly.  Where I live we can only use CDMA phones so I was nervous.  Again worked great

I received it Friday and upon having it plugged in and setting up the phone, it flashed on and off for about an hour then came on for about an hr and hasn’t been back on since. I cannot get the phone to come back on to get Apple ID off and was not able to turn on the find my iPhone bc the phone kept going off during setup. They state I cannot return the phone until I get Apple ID turned off. This is a scam!!! Do NOT buy a phone from them. How they are still selling here amazes me.

  Don’t buy this... was told it had apple care. The serial number on the SIM tray showed it did, but the actual number assigned to the phone itself did not have apple care. Phone started smoking after a couple months of use and had to pay full price for a new phone from apple. Very sketchy and not worth it. Just buy a new phone through apple and cut out the unnecessary “renewed” middle man

  I was looking for an older model iPhone with a good amount of life left in it. Since the 8 isn’t sold new anywhere, this refurbished option seemed worth a try. Upon arrival the phone was unlocked and in great shape with only a few minor scrapes on the outside edge; battery life was at 88% of original. The only small problem I was having was that the response to touch on the screen was intermittent, something with which I could probably manage.I decided to ask the seller about a replacement; once I started the return process (with a request for a replacement) the seller communicated very quickly and had a label for me to mail the old phone back that same day.The replacement came in as quickly as the old went out. It had a more responsive touch screen and even better battery life. So far no other problems.I am very happy with the used / renewed phone and even happier that the seller was so easy to work with. Thanks!Seller was PDI Mobile.

  NEVER purchase from this CHUBBIES TECH! My son purchased a refurbished phone and 6 months later the microphone and FaceTime no longer work. When we brought it to the Apple Store, they informed us the phone had been serviced 4 separate times with previous owners. We had NO idea! Dealers selling refurbished items should be required to disclose this information to potential buyers. The dealer, Chubbies Tech is standing by their 90 day policy and not offering any help. WASTE OF MONEY!!

  To begin , my seller was Chubbiestech, the phone arrived two days early in the AmazonRenewed box, included was a charger, cord, screen protector, and sim tool. The phone itself was pristine, absolutely spotless. Zero scratches, dents, or marks. And it has 91% of it's battery capacity. the phone functions perfectly, it arrived in such a condition that i would have thought it was a brand new phone straight from the Apple store!. I had been reading some of the concerning negative reviews and decided to purchase this phone, i do not regret it one bit. i am very pleased.

  It came a couple of days before it was expected to which was great. Opened the box and it was just the phone and a charger like advertised. I’m very surprised at the look of it. The phone looks like it’s brand new. It works very great. It is unlocked and was easy just to pop in my sim from my iPhone 6s into this iPhone 8. I upgraded from the 6s to the 8 because I have had the 6s for 5 years now and never gotten it cracked or broken or anything and it works fine but in the last couple of weeks to a month now it seems like the 6s battery isn’t lasting as long after a charge so instead of finding a place to try to get it replace for god knows how much I figured it was time to upgrade my phone and now I’m glad I did.

  I picked up the phone to replace my wife’s iPhone 6. Prior to buying an iPhone 8 through this method I read through a bunch of reviews. I admit that I was a bit nervous about buying the “renewed” device. I took the chance and bought it. The device was in really good shape. These phones are all glass. There wasn’t a scratch on the thing. It is pristine. My own 8plus has been in cases the entire time I’ve owned it and it looks more worn than the 8 I purchased here. There are zero signs of wear on the lightning port . Battery was at 90% health. I updated it to iOS 13 (it had 12) The phone looks and runs as if it were brand new.  I can safely recommend this product and seller.

  At first I thought I got scammed because the box it came in was just a generic smartphone box, which sounds fine at first, but the box had the details of a completely different phone so I was sweating a bit when I saw that. The phone was correct, though, and came in good condition. It wasn't perfect, as you'd expect from a refurbished phone; there was a tiny scuff in the metal on the upper right corner, but that doesn't bother me one bit since it's covered by my case. I think that $280 is a good price for a well-refurbished iPhone 8, since it also comes with the trust that it's in top renewed condition versus buying for less from FB marketplace or something like that. I also purchased the protection plan which covers drops, cracks, water damage, etc. and it is well worth it to me. After the initial $50 payment, paying $29 to have my phone repaired or $49 to have it replaced in the case of it breaking is a great deal of a protection plan to me.

Even though they accepted the refund request immediately, they never gave me the money back ( it took me a month of begging them!) and Amazon finally stepped in and gave me my refund. I bought another phone from them at the same time, the other phone seems to be working just fine.

Worst of all it was sunday and the seller Kanga Supply wasn't available.I arrived at my destination country on sunday , put a local SIM card and voilá! It's working!Later i asked a friend and he told me this happens a lot with US carrier locked phones which at some point get unlocked, they don't work with US SIM cards.Phone is working fine after 5 days and is in great aesthetic conditions. Haven't tried headphones because it didn't come with any accesories besides a generic charger and SIM tool.I think the seller or Amazon should put this warning on the product page.

    PHONE'S IMEI NUMBER BLACKLISTED AS LOST/STOLEN

  The phone initially worked just fine and I was able to make a few phone calls after getting a sim card from my carrier. A few hours later, however, I realized I wasn't getting authentication text messages while trying to set up social media apps. While trying to make a test phone call, I was redirected to my carrier's customer service line. The representative informed me that the phone's IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number had been blacklisted as lost/stolen and that I would be unable to use the device until it had been removed from the blacklist by either Apple or Verizon (the former carrier). This is unacceptable considering I paid for a fully unlocked phone. On top of that, the headset speaker sounds tinny as if it was damaged from playing music too loudly. Phone calls are nearly unintelligible and music quality sounds worse than my iPhone 5s. I am very disappointed overall with this ""Renewed"" product that Amazon stands behind.

  I gave this phone a 1 only because the seller is not describing it properly.  It is a gsm phone and, as such, does not work on Verizon or Sprint the same way a Verizon or Sprint phone will work.  Those carriers use CDMA phones, so a gsm phone will not get the same coverage.  It worked in as far as I could get it activated to make calls, receive texts and be fully functional, but only in certain areas.  I had an iPhone6 & an iPhone 4 before that, both with Verizon & both of those worked all the time at my boyfriend's house & never once lost service in 6 years.  Then I bought this phone & had service fine until I got to his house & then my phone said ""no service"".  It did this repeatedly for a few days every time I went to his house & stayed that way the whole time I was there even though my boyfriend's Verizon iPhone 8 worked in the same house at the same time & never lost service.  I called Verizon & they said this phone was a T-Mobile phone & is a gsm phone & explained that if I want the same level of coverage I had before I need an unlocked phone that was originally a Verizon phone so that it is a CDMA phone.  I guess an original Sprint phone would work, too, since those are CDMA phones.  I told Amazon that they need to require the sellers of cell phones to identify the phone as gsm or CDMA.

  I was hesitant to order bc of how long it said it would take to arrive, however it arrived in less than a week (a whole week earlier than expected). I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the phone. Not one single scratch on the screen, rear glass surface, or camera lens. There were some small surface scratches on the paint close to the camera lens, but that is to be expected with a refurbished phone. Other than that, it was in perfect condition. It is fully operational, and took the AT&T SIM card that I had when I first tried it. Where I’m located, Verizon is the way to go bc AT&T service sucks around here. When my Verizon sim arrived from straight talk, I popped it in and called the customer service line. She worked her magic and paired the phone’s IME number with the Verizon sim, and after about 20 minutes it was working perfectly on the Verizon sim. So when they say all carriers, it actually works on both AT&T and Verizon carriers.Also, I wasn’t even expecting a new cord and charger, but there it was in the box. I was also expecting to have to go find a paperclip to install my sim, but low and behold they included the sim removal tool too! For a 256Gb phone that is unlocked on all carriers, I’m extremely impressed. The battery had about 80% capacity, which is great too.I’m excited to have a shiny new phone, and I didn’t have to pay an arm and a leg to one of the big cell companies or sign and contract to get it! I’m all about not signing cell contracts these days. So thank you for having great quality phones for purchase! I will purchase from them again in the near future when it’s time for me to upgrade once again

   I do like writing reviews especially for used phones because it helps everyone. A special shout out to the Synergy phone renewal program team. My iPhone 8 came in perfect condition with the battery capacity of.....99%, really. When I ordered this phone last week I was having second thoughts about needing an iPhone just for work as I already have a iPhone 12mini but didn't want to use it for both personal and work so I took a chance and went with the 8, I was going to get a 7 but the 8 is only $15 more. I kind of hoped it would have some scuffs and that the battery was at 70 something percent capacity  so I could send it back and just use my 12 mini but I don't want the wear and tear on that battery alone as the 12 mini already has a small battery. I told myself the phone would need to be perfect and I would keep it, well perfect it was. I have ordered a Samsung galaxy s8, and it had screen burn in as well as a galaxy s9 plus that had a swollen battery (NOT FROM SYNERGY) so used phones can be hit or miss but this iPhone is brand new just in a different generic box but it came with the official iPhone cable and charging brick, all for $170.00 + tax. So yes I am keeping this for work and am as happy as I will ever be from a used phone, thank you Synergy, you all rock.

  Apple products are expensive.  Many people cannot wait to upgrade...our family just waits for people to do just that and for companies to refurbish perfectly good phones.  This one came in less than 6 days, all functions working properly, just as advertised was unlocked, bluetooth transfer of data in less than 30 minutes.  The only slightly negative comment is that the refurbished phone came with generic charger and not Apple products.  No ear bud jack in this phone, so remember to get wireless earbuds.

  I received my two phones in two days a stated with amazon prime. Phone looked really good to be refurbished. Normal scratches not too noticeable nothing too bad cosmetics wise. Came with a charger and block piece; comes inside small amazon boxes wrapped in bubble wrap for extra protection. I had no problem logging into my iCloud. I switched carriers from sprint to metro which was the reason for purchase. CDMA and GSM are completely different. The phones worked just fine . The IMEI was clear and was not on the blacklist. SIM cards were activated and put in and within 45 I had new service with these phones. I did take them to the store and let the rep put in the SIM cards. Though only been active for 24 hours on these phones. No complaint so far only that the battery does not hold a charge like a newer phone might . So keep a charger near, especially if you use your phone a lot during the day. Overall I’ll say 4.5/5 I’m very satisfied for the price I paid.

  It's definitely ""buyer beware"" when buying a ""renewed"" iPhone from Verizon -- because Verizon's iPhones are not truly renewed.  The last two that I have purchased from Verizon have had their battery health levels fall below 80 within three (3) weeks, and two (2) months, respectively.  One of the two displayed a ""battery significantly degraded"" message.  What a waste of my time and Amazon's refund, shipping, and return expenses.  Suggestion for Verizon:  why don't you focus your efforts on selling iPhones that have acceptable levels of battery health?  #NeverAgainfromVerizon

  I ordered this phone on December 20th and it was expected to come on the 31st. To my surprise it came just two days after on December 23rd without Amazon Prime. As for the phone itself, it worked well and looked new from afar. I think there were some minor scuffs but nothing a phone case can't hide. The phone itself came with a charger though it wasn't an official apple one, still I appreciate that there was a charger. The only negative thing was that my phone is a Japanese phone so when I take photos even with the phone on silent, it still makes a shutter noise. It is an unlocked phone so take it to your provider so they can insert your sim card into it, it is a very simple process. Overall a great phone, if you can't afford to buy a new iPhone from the store, buy this one instead! I am very happy with my purchase.

The screen has been replaced with an aftermarket product. The battery health is at 80%, barely meeting the minimum requirement. There’s nothing about this phone that is like new or refurbished.

  As the title says, works as well as the iPhone 7. Replaced it because I thought a problem was hardware related (turned out it wasn’t). Do like the expanded 64 GB memory over the 32 GB memory of the 7 because I can have my entire music library onboard. Use music, podcasts, calendar, all of it. Signing in to my account, the phone filled with all my apps and data. Honestly don’t notice it’s much faster with updated chip and I seldom use the camera, so newer features don’t make a significant difference to me but bottom line is is works as well as I’m used to. Will use it until I upgrade to iPhone 12 when that comes out, so I can be ready for 5G when it really it deployed and working (most places have little to no 5G, regardless of what the ads say).

  I have never left a bad review.  We own two businesses and I get the impact that reviews could have on a company.  It came with a charger and that charger is the only charger the phone worked on.  My 15 year old daughter saved ALL year for this $397 iphone 8.  It lasted 3.5 months.  We went on vacation and she forgot her charger.  By the way, it was still in warranty when we left for vacation.  Her phone would not work with any other iphone charger that we had.  I do not know much about the mechanical part of phones other than how to operate them. We went to a technician on vacation thinking it was the battery. Battery was fine, charge port was fine.  He said the chip was bad on the mother board and to fix it would be significant.  The technician said the seller KNEW this phone had a problem and sold it anyway.  Amazon contacted seller. Seller emailed me it's 2 weeks out of warranty go to a repair shop.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.

  Sadly they had sent a phone that was defective and would shut down randomly, with research I found this was a hardware problem in some IPhones. I wish they would have done more extensive testing on their products before shipping to customers. They provided a full refund in a timely manner which was nice.

  I got this iPhone for my daughter who has been asking for a iPhone for awhile. I was very skeptical because of some of the reviews. I went ahead and ordered the phone. It arrived early and was in very good condition.  The phone looks new to me. Took it to Metropcs and got it activated with no problems. The only con about this phone is the battery health, which was at 84%. Other than that I’m completely satisfied. My daughter loves it. I bought it from the seller Hybrid IT.

  Received on Friday.  Transferred data and programs from old phone on Sunday.  Will be hooking it up to AT&T on Monday.  So far the phone works well, except the battery seems to discharge rather quickly (possibly a result of too many apps running, but I'll be checking that out soon).  In any event, I am quite pleased with my purchase.

  I've bought several 'renewed' phones over the years and this was the first that was visibly damaged with a scratched screen - one scratch about 1.5cm long.  The battery is showing as able to charge to 95% of its original capacity, which is prety good for an older phone, but again not as good as I've had in the past.  Delivery and functionality are all great.

  I am a 12 year old girl, and I payed my own money for this phone. It came in the mail on the last day that it said it would, so kind of on time. The only cosmetic problem is that the outer ring of the camera is a bit scratched, but you can hardly see it. The touch screen works perfectly. The fingerprint reader doesn’t read your finger when your hands are sweaty, but that is the only time. I put in my left thumb, right thumb, left pointer, and right pointer into the thing and all of them work 99% of the time. The battery life is good, but I leave it on dark mode, True Tone off, and I always like to keep the brightness down. The phone adapts to the brightness of your surroundings, and so if you’re in a dark room, it goes dark and vice versa. Overall the phone is great, and I definitely recommend it, especially for the price. I hope that this review is helpful.

  The overall physical condition of my “refurbished” iPhone 8 is excellent!  I can’t find a scratch on the device.  The transfer of SIM cards to this phone was easy and fast, since the phone was unlocked already.  My only complaint is that the battery health of the device is at 87%.  When you get below 90 you start to notice, and in this case, it’s easy to do that.  The phone drops a full 100% charge rather quickly.  The price was low enough, that investing in a new battery is worth it.  That’s my only complaint.  All and all this was a good deal and a good quality iPhone 8.

  Overall, I've been very pleased with this refurbed phone. It was delivered in like new condition and until recently has acted like new. Recently, the phone's charging receptacle stopped working without finagling the connector. I have tried 3 different Apple branded charging wires and chargers and it's the same with all 3. I have to insert and re-insert the Lightning wire several times, hold it just right, carefully place it at an angle and set a weight on the phone by the connector. Only then will it charge. Unfortunately, it is out of warranty and I'm sure it will be too expensive to fix. So I guess when I can no longer find the sweet spot to charge it, I'll look for another refurbished iPhone.On a side note, for my daughter, I bought an identical refurbished phone at the same time (different vendor, but I don't think that matters here), and it's working perfectly.

It will not recognize my phone number, only apple id and only on wifi.Emailed rep as the note said before leaving review. their response was to question if it's user error. Reset the phone as suggested. read apple forums to troubleshoot. turned on and off imessage. restarted, reset again. No apologies from the ""customer service."" Seems like they erased data from a broken phone to sell as refurbished. Huge disappointment

  It’s a great phone. My other iPhone was small and broken. This is slightly bigger so that’s nice. It works great. You have to sign for the package, so be home when it’s delivered or they won’t leave it. I’m using it now to write this, so I can tell you it works great. When I got it I just popped out the SIM card from my old phone, so I personally didn’t have to go to the phone store. Maybe you will have to go in, maybe not, I’m not sure. But my experience was great. Thanks!

  My concerns when purchasing a refurbished or renewed iPhone would be:- is it what I ordered? Yes, an iPhone 8 with 64 GB.- Are there scratches on the shell? No. Some scratches would have been acceptable, since I would put the phone in a case anyway.- Are there scratches on the glass? No, in fact the phone had a protective film installed (probably by the original owner).- Is the battery in good shape? Sort of. Battery Health, Maximum Capacity reports 82%. That's the only disappointment. I imagine that battery health will vary.

  I was skeptical again ordering Renewed smartphones off Amazon.  But this time I tried the New Premium renewed iphone 8 unlocked Gold.  The phone was perfect, not a flaw anywhere on the device, came with a new shark charger and cable.  Everything works perfect and battery health and performance is as promised.  I've been using it daily for almost 2 months, comes with a one year 100% satisfaction warranty.  Hope Amazon keeps adding more phones to their Premium line, seems they are batter than the regular renewed phones.

As soon as it arrived the camera kept freezing on me then stopped working all together. Getting support was a joke. I spent over an hour total with two different support people walking me through every solution they could think of. Press this button, hold the sleep button, now try this and that and 100 other things. What a waste of time! I gave up and said can you send me a replacement and they never even acknowledge it just kept going with this and that to get it to work. I finally just submitted a return. What a headache!!

  I used to be an apple fanatic and then I switched to Google Pixel. Recently had a bad experience with a refurbished Google Pixel 2 phone because I failed to read the buyers reviews (always read them folks especially when buying refurbished phones) and I decided to go back to Apple because, why not.I didn't want any of the latest models because honestly I don't care for them so I was looking for an iPhone 8 in good quality and with significant storage. I came across this one and I was able to find a 64GB gold iPhone 8 through Verizon pre-owned. Honestly, highly recommend buying from Verizon pre-owned because not only did it accept my Cricket Wireless SD card effortlessly BUT, the phone is literally intact. It basically looks brand new. No scratches, not even on the corners. Clean screen and back of the phone. The fingerprinting works perfectly. All of its features work as if it was a brand new phone! Plus battery life so far has been doing incredibly well. So if you're thinking about switching over but are skeptical, try looking at Verizon pre-owned and their reviews and purchase!Looking forward to continuing taking bomb selfies with this phone.

  I’ve bem using it for 2 weeks and it looks perfect. The battery will have 90% of the capacity but I strongly recomend in buying this. I iniciatially bought this to sell the phone in a trade-in but I liked it and now I am going to stay with it. I am from brazil and it is working with no problem at all

    What I like - this is ""like new"" as promised

  When I bought this used/refurbished phone, I was just happy to get an ""upgrade"" from my ancient IPhone 6; what I needed was something secondhand, affordable and still usable.I was pleasantly surprised to receive this order in a condition like new—even pristine, as promised by seller.In terms of functionality, the sensors and controls feel as though I've bought a new phone. All 256gb was available. The speakers, microphone and display work very well.When I was switching out the sim card from my old IPhone 6, the IPhone 8 started detecting the switch and offered an immediate transfer, without my activating the migration function - very cool. The transfer was so near perfect that the IPhone 8 migrated all my WhatsApp messages, which I was expecting to lose (because I don't use icloud). The migration was near perfect because for some apps or platforms, I needed to type in the initial passwords again (even though they were transferred to and saved on the IPhone 8) - just the slight bother of retyping a few passwords one more time.By the way, I am a Singapore buyer, and this order was routed through an Oregon transshipment facility, before it was shipped to Singapore.What's the takeaway I can offer in this review? Buying a secondhand product could be a lucky draw: there is a chance you may get a dud. In this order, I am happy to say that I got exactly what the seller promised. So here's my 5-star thumbs up!

  Alright so I wanted to give it some time before I wrote a review on our phone (in case we came across any problems with it). Fortunately, we’ve had our IPhone 8 since December now it’s January and have had zero problems with it. The phone actually came in pristine condition, no scratches or blown out/distorted speaker or any other problems! I do see that there’s others here that, sadly, have problems with their phone from the minute they receive it and I think it has a lot to do with the seller. Before I purchased our phone I checked the different sellers and ratings/reviews and ultimately we went with Hybrid IT. Take a look for yourselves, I strongly recommend this seller for anyone looking to get one of these phones!

    Terrific phone after a second delivery!

  The phone I have now works so well, it's in seemingly perfect condition! For what I paid for a used phone, I feel the seller deserves praise for the product at the end of the day. I wish I could give four stars. There were several communication issues/ product issues that I felt took this order in a wonky direction. 1.) The order was sent to my address with signature required. When I asked to remove the required signature (I'm not home all the time), the package was sent the next day to a location one state away. Rather than spend another four to five days without a phone, I chose to drive a half hour through a different state to pick up the package at the FedEx facility. Okay.2.) The first phone stopped working after a few weeks. Believe me, being without a phone for a few days can be a risky issue (I don't even have a phone at home, what if I had to call 911? My employer? Etc.) They gave me a VERY quick and flexible response, saying they would replace or return the phone. Amazing response! They told me to remove my iCloud info and delete the email app, which was impossible because it wouldn't even turn on, but no problem, they removed the iCloud account and email when I turned it in somehow. However, they did not mention that I would have to hold onto the SIM card!So they sent me a new iPhone, nice model, everything fine, except- no SIM card. 3.) No SIM card. By this time the world was in the middle of an epidemic crisis, my carrier was closed except for in one location (fine) but the carrier veritably chased me away yelling at me to call because they had no functioning service (not fine - no phone.) After all the drama I figured out how to call them without activation on my own. A few days later I got the SIM. Anyway, the NEW phone works outstandingly, the exchange was smooth, they were very fast at messaging and did a terrific job of offering me an exchange immediately with no extra fees. However the lack of notice about a signature requirement upon delivery, the first phone battery stopping completely, and the lack of communication about holding my old SIM card backed up my phone use. I'm all set now though. Four stars.

  I bought the Renewed Premium to get a better Iphone 8 and that was money well spent. The battery life was important as I had a previous Iphone 6S and the battery was horrible. This time the battery was at 91% and the initial charge went from 100% to 50% in 5 days, thought I admit I don't use the phone often. The fact that I did not use the phone often did not stop the previous phones from losing the charge within 24 hours. The phone operates very nicely and has all the options I need. The phone is in excellent condition also. I certainly recommend!

  This should be against the law. To sell a fake iphone for $400 and not make it well known that it is a FAKE IPHONE is disgusting! The phones volume would cut out at random and when I try to restart it it would take hours. After a few weeks it would not read my SIM card so I took it to my carrier phone store and they told me that it was not a real! SHAMEFUL!!!

  Shipping was fast but the phone was scratched, sometimes it wont shift between camera settings, and there was NO SIM card! I was very frustrated.I lost my iPhone 11 so the iPhone 8  is my back up. The camera quality feels so poor compared to what I’m used to but that has nothing to do with the seller.I just really wish I would’ve been more aware that the seller did not include a SIM card with purchase of the phone.I live six hours round-trip from a Verizon store so they had to ship me the SIM card before I could even activate the phone. That took another 5 days.

    Beware!!!! Refurbished with a BAD BATTERY.  5 months  - phone dead.

  I purchased this refurbished phone 3/7/2020 for $229.96.  Prior to purchasing the phone, I  asked about the battery life.  Now, the battery is dead as of 8/5/2020, less than 5 months after purchase.  Usage cost me $45.99/month average based on purchase price.  I could have had a current brand new  IPhone for that monthly usage cost.  Do not use this vendor.  They should have replaced the battery as a good will gesture even if past warranty date.  As a business owner, that is how I would have taken care of a customer to earn future business from them.  Shame on ELECTRONIC DEALS.Reply from  vendor:Hi Brigitte, we are very sorry to hear this. Unfortunately, the order is past 90 days old and the warranty period has expired. We suggest taking the device in to Apple or a local authorized Apple technician for repair.We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences caused.Kind Regards,ELECTRONIC DEALS FAMILY & STAFF

  Bought it for my wife and she is pissed. This phone is not unlocked as it says in the description. Took it to the apple store and they were unable to do anything with it. They said it is probably a stolen phone that still has a balance with Tmobile. Will be returning for a refund.

  This product was purchased by my daughter and according to her it was in really good shape to be used/refurbished. I looked at the phone it came with minimal scratches....no cracks. It doesn't come with original apple packaging....but the phone is as promised and good value for price. It does come in a white box with what appears to be a new charger and the little pin to unlock SIM card is underneath the inner packaging. Would purchase from this store again.

  I bought a used iphone 8 and it was amazon certified. I opened it and saw no scratches or any damage whatsoever. I wanted to use it for a while before I did a review. I have had it about a month now and I havent had any issues at all with the phone's performance. Battery lasts a long time, no dropped calls and fast internet connection regardless of wifi/no wifi.I was so leery about getting a used phone. I've always gone new. When I saw it was only $200, it's worth a shot vs spending $800 on a new phone again. They gave me a 90 day return policy as well for the piece of mind. So far, this was the best bang-for-buck deal rather than buying a new phone. As long as I dont have any issues in the near future, I will continue to buy used phones from Amazon that are certified.

  The good:1. The phone was delivered in a timely fashion just before Christmas.2. It looked perfect, no physical defects.The bad & the ugly:1. I discovered the phone came from Japan where the camera sound cannot be turned off, by law. Took it to the Apple Store, and said they couldn't do anything about it. I take a lot of photos, and the loud click is a pain. But, that was a minor detail for the price.2. Most importantly, the phone locked up suddenly. The Apple Store couldn't unlock it. The only way was to wipe it clean to factory settings. Lost everything that wasn't stored in the cloud, including my photos. The phone has a 256 GB memory. Didn't want to bother with paying extra storage space in the cloud. Let's hope this doesn't happen again... Or else, monthly payments on a NEW phone may no longer look as optional... :(

  The phone arrived early but couldn't be set up for a while b/c of the pandemic.  Then it was either locked or had some other problem and took Two phone calls, 2 technicians and a supervisor to be able to figure out what to do.  Imagine that, I sat in T-Mobile for almost an hour thinking I would have to return this one (which I should have because the battery life is not even a day.  The phone gets hot faster than I had expected or previously experienced.  The volume is maybe 70 percent of what it should be.  Live and learn, but I really can't be without a phone and I sure wouldn't use this company due to the problems (I still don't know why there were so many issues with setting it up at T-Mobile) and it is used for remote working, telehealth, etc.  I'm pretty much stuck with a phone that I doubt lasts a year; the battery could die any day now.

  I thank the seller because I was skeptical about the purchase and debated for a bit before taking the leap and purchasing. I am so glad that I did. I can understand why the seller is listed as the Best and are ranked as #1. Just like others who purchased this phone, I expected it to have issues and not be worth the purchase. However, I received the phone 5 days earlier than noted. It also arrived literally looking brand new and it works as if I had just purchased a brand new Iphone. Let's just say I am overly excited that I got such a deal and an amazing purchase. I am ready to buy all kinds of cases and accessories for my new phone! Yay!

  It was such a nice relief to receive a renewed phone that looked new, packaged as a new device with vinyl covering on front and back and everything to get my son going.  The customer support was phenomenal!  To be fair, I ran into a small issue with the battery. Battery health was 79% after opening it and using it for 2 weeks...did we check that status before...no.  The seller says it should always be above 80% and will gladly refund, return and replace it or pay for battery replacement if I visit an authorized Apple store.  I chose the easiest for everyone and scheduled a repair and replaced the battery.  Seller not only reimbursed the total amount, it was actually more that the receipt I sent, maybe for my time and effort?  In any case, totally happy with the purchase, completely satisfied with customer service and highly recommend this seller.  Phone looked perfect and still acts 100%, like-new, 3 months later.

  After two bad IPhone purchases on Ebay, both refunded, and no luck finding a decent IPhone 8 on Gazelle I was hesitant to order another pre-owned IPhone. However, this IPhone was as advertised. Mint condition, excellent battery life and yes, it was actually an unlocked  model 1863. Dropped in my MetroPCS sim card and was up and running immediately. Good purchase and would buy again.

  I just received my phone yesterday and it works good and looks good. The reviews are correct, the Gold is the Rose Gold which is what I wanted! However, I have put in my Straight Talk SIM card and the data does not work. It says Verizon at the top and I've had an issue before buying a Verizon phone not working with my SIM card. I'm not sure what to do?

    I don't think Kanga Supply does a very in-depth quality assurance
  
","









  
  
    
  By reading some other reviews and based on my own experience I feel as though Kanga Supply, probably doesn't do a very intensive quality assurance on their products. If I could guess, they get a lot of refurbished used phones, which for the majority of the time work fine, but there are going to be quite a few phones that are faulty. The phone I received wouldn't even turn on, despite trying to charge it with 3 different chargers. I guess it's my fault for not looking at their website, where they make no guarantees that their products work. If you need a phone immediately, I wouldn't suggest buying from here, unless your willing to wait 3-4 business days for an exchange or refund.

  The phone seemed well at first, all outside conditions were great other than minor scratches. But the phone would sometimes shut down as if dead when could be at high charge. When it would power back on it would say it was completely dead and would only let me be on it for a few minutes before restarting the pattern. Phone wouldn't charge during these moments so there was literally nothing i can do. And sometimes when the phone would do this is would go right back to its normal charge and work as normal until the sequence started back up. This was extremely annoying when i would be busy on my phone. One morning i woke up and the phone would not power on at all, even when tried charging with multiple chargers. I sent it to apple thinking this was a simple battery problem and i could pay a cheap $49 for a replacement but later got a message saying that the phone was completely defected an the problem was far beyond just the need of a battery replacement. Refunding immediately.

  Dislikes:1. Because this was a refurbished unit, the battery life is not that of a new phone.2. The Wi-Fi hotspot loses connectivity - at times it is better to is the Bluetooth connection, which eats more data.3. I came from android, so the inability to put widgets on any multiple screens is disappointing. This makes the ""Home Screen"", which is the only place you can put widgets, useless. I want my weather widget on top of my most used apps on the first page of my phone. Apple offers very limited widgets. Most apps do not have one.4. There is a glitch in the iPhone 8 that causes it to very frequently turn the volume all the way down at random times.Likes:1. Not requiring anti-virus is nice.2. Siri is worlds better than Google Assist. (waiting for some developments that would allow additional voice activated options, like ""Siri, read me the content of website xyz"", etc.). Siri is the main reason I switched from android. It is awesome!!!

  There are several people on here that wrote reviews saying the phone didn't work on Verizon, broke shortly after, etc.  It certainly made me pause before purchasing, but I really needed a replacement phone for my son and wasn't going to pay top dollar for a new phone again.I ordered the phone on a Tuesday, and was surprised when the FedEx box showed up on Thursday (a full 4 days earlier than estimated).  Next, the packaging was decent and included a genuine charger plug and cable.  Finally, the phone looked absolutely brand new.  Not a touch or smudge anywhere.  I immediately took it to the Verizon store, and they got it registered on the network within 5 minutes.I know there are other reviews that had similar experiences as mine, but you always think that you are going to be the one that gets the dud that doesn't work.  It would seem like it's a good company though and perhaps they'd swap it out if you happen to be unlucky (I can imagine it has to occasionally happen - it is a used phone after all, each with a different history).  Apparently I got one from a grandma that didn't take it out of the box. :)Overall, very happy.  Hopefully you will be just as fortunate.  And if not, I'd feel safe about working with them company to make it right.

  First time buying a refurb phone. Daughter needed a replacement for her old one that looked as if someone had taken a sledge hammer to it. How does a phone get like that? Works great. Delivered with a good battery. It was at or very near 100% life. No dings or scratches. With 256GB of storage I will never hear again about running out of storage. Came with used protective glass installed which had a few chips in the corner but no big deal. Have not got to it yet, but easily replaced. Also bought a silicome cover and replacement glass. 9 months, so far, so good. Could have saved an extra $60 if I had waited until after the Christmas season.

  I've had this phone for a little over a month now and I love it! I was somewhat scared to buy a refurbished phone, but so far this phone is working wonderfully and arrived in nearly perfect condition. There was a teeny tiny little scratch on the side of the phone, but it is barely noticeable. I only noticed it because I was looking for imperfections when I received the phone. It is much cheaper than buying an apple certified refurbished phone and is probably the exact same quality. Unfortunately, the charger is not an apple product, but is working well so far. If you're looking for a quality new phone that is not ridiculously expensive, I would highly recommend purchasing this one!

  Purchased two rose gold iPhone 8’s from the company TRADEMORE. The phones arrived in two days and in great condition. Everything seems to work as it should including the cameras, speaker, microphone, and touchscreen. The battery health is above 80% on both phones; which is great for a used/refurbished phone. There is no cosmetic damage to be noted, and all functions worked upon installing my SIM card.TRADEMORE sends the phones in their own packaging and includes a Verizon wall pack with an 8 ft usb to lightning cable. Inside the packaging included a flyer that ensures a 90 day warranty. I’m pleased with the phones and would buy from this company again.

  Looked like brand new.  Manual not in box but since it is a refurbished, I didn't expect it and it's easy enough to download on the net.  Works like brand new.  The only thing I didn't realize was Apple changed the shade of gold.  Not too happy with Apple but very happy with the product over all.  A nice black case solved the new apple gold problem.  The best thing?  the price.

    Review on Apple iPhone 8, GSM Unlocked, 256GB - Space Gray (Renewed)
  
","









  
  
    
  Really nice... It seems a brand new iPhone 8, out of the box.  At first, I wasn't sure whether I should buy or not because of there are a lot of negative reviews for this particular phone along with its seller (vendor).  Thus far, I have no issue with the iPhone 8.  Of course, all consumers would be so cautious when he/she is looking for a refurbished/used phone.  If I were to pick one minor thing that this phone should have is that ""No place for an ear-pieces.""  Other than this particular one is missing, I would highly recommend to others to consider if you're looking for a refurbished iPhone.

  Phone shipped a day sooner than scheduled. When I took it out of the box, I thought it was brand new. I charged it up and set it next to my old iPhone 7 and everything auto transferred, updates processed and the phone works flawlessly. I’m so impressed, and I was worried about buying a used phone. Battery is well over 85%. Great purchase so far. It came with a 90 day warranty. If any issues develop I’ll report with an updated review, but I anticipate all will be good.

  For 300 this is a great deal. Only problem is this is a Japanese model and should be advertised as such. One, and very annoying difference is the stupid camera sound is forced on no matter what. All those perverts over there in Japan need to calm down. Besides that, the phone is of above average condition with a few minor blemishes, but that’s to be expected at this price. Battery is at 92%

Or require a signature, or ring the bell!  Something!!  It was inboxed!  No Apple charging cord or plug!  The screen ha many little scratches and is cloudy!  Won’t but from this complaint again.  The reviews were good so I felt confident with my purchase.

  Had to replace my moms iPhone 4SE, and I was a little hesitant because of some of the reviews. It shipped very quickly and it showed up very well packed. Opened and gotta say It looks brand new. Not a scratch or dent. Came with like a 10ft charging cable. Put the verizon sim in and Bam set it up. Was easy, no issue at all. My mom loves it and would definitely would buy again.

Since I had no intention to return it, I sent a message to the seller so we could try to fix it in time, but I had no answer. Now I realize how important the phone camera is these days, and I'm stock with a phone with a defective camera. I regret buying it.

  The reviews made this seem more like a roulette thing since the iPhone that I bought here works as expected, light scratches to the screen, not that many scratches in the back which is good. Fingerprint reader works great, very fast. Both cameras work great too. The charger that came with the phone along with other cheap ones though don’t work at all, I have to use a really good quality one and it solved my problem. Overall I highly recommend to buy this product if you press your luck.

Llevé el aparato a una tienda Apple y a T Mobile y me explicaron que la única razón por la que no leía mi información era porque no estaba liberado.Mi mayor molestia fue que al recibir el reembolso de mi dinero me descontaron 30 dolares. No puedo estar de acuerdo con eso! Me venden un equipo que no funciona y además me descuentan dinero.Espero que esta pésima experiencia sirva para tomar correctivos y mejorar su costumer service .

  Compre un iPhone 8 re-manufacturado y revisado. Se supone que ha sido revisado y el parlante frontal llego defectuoso. Se escucha ronco y no se entiende bien lo que dice la otra persona. Cuando lo recibí la habian bajado el volumen para que no se notara el daño en un claro gesto de deshonestidad. Sabían que el parlante estaba malo y no lo arreglaron.

  Phone arrived and it was everything I'd expect from an iPhone 8, with one critical exception: it was MQ862J/A. The main difference this makes on a day to day basis for anyone buying this is that the camera sound is hardwired on due to Japanese law. So, caveat emptor, you may be stuck with the annoying camera sound.

  The phone came quicker than expected; the delivery was on point. I was actually nervous about buying the phone but it is better than I expected. The only defect on the phone was a small prick where the SIM card is place; it looked as though someone used something else to try and open it. As for the battery, it last for a full day because I work with my phone and always in the Wifi zone. Otherwise, I think it’s safe to say good buy..... I’ve had it for almost one month now.

There was no plastic film over the screen to take of as it says it’s “ renewed “ I expect the screen to come with that phone is completely dead as well hoping for good results when it turns on right now I am not impressed so far

  This phone was faulty. It would consistently say “cellular error”, turn on and off, and sign out of my iCloud account. Absolutely disastrous. I had to follow up and send MANY messages to the seller to finally get refunded nearly a month after sending back the phone. Do yourself a favor and do not bother.

  The battery will have to be replaced soon and I just got the phone 10 days ago.  It will not make it through 1.5 days without a charge. I am older than 50 and do not use my phone that much so it’s not my usage.  When checking the settings, it says battery is very degraded.  Will not ever buy a renewed phone through Amazon.  By the time I replace the battery,  I have the same $$ wrapped up in the phone if I had just bought a new one.

  I bought this phone for my mom who was maxing out her storage on her iPhone 6. The phone works fine (a lot better then an 6). The charger provided in the box didn’t work and the screen wasn’t completely flush with the case but that isn’t a problem. The phone also had a couple of dirt marks on it but after a wipe they can right off. Additionally, the phone said that the battery health was at 100%. Overall I would recommend this phone and there was no major problems.

  If I could give this product a zero I would. Ordered this phone once and the front camera didn't work. Decided to return it and replace it with another phone from this same vendor. BIG mistake-- the second phone's front camera doesn't work either! Clearly they do not quality check their products before they send them out. Don't waste your time and money!

  Its honestly a great phone, and it works well. Everything about it is fine, it still has 89% battery capacity, the cameras are great, its very fast. The only problem is that when I got it the phone was still locked onto another carrier. My carrier is Metro PCS and they told me that I would have to talk to the seller and get them to actually unlock the phone because it's still locked onto another account. This is very frustrating. Hopefully I can return the phone and actually get it unlocked soon.

  The phone came as promised. Externally it looked good, and after updating the software it accepted my SIM card with no problems. The screen protected it came with cracked within the first day of use. The battery had a maximum capacity of 85%, which was expected. However, the phone does discharge when being used very quickly. It can go from full to empty in only 2 hours. Very good quality for the price, except for the battery life.

I'm debating on whether I should pay to fix it or just return the phone because it's so impractical and doesn't work even close to right.

Mine even came with a screen protector already attached! I’m bad about dropping my phone so that was definitely a plus. The battery life is sooo much better than my previous 6S, and the camera and everything works wonderfully. The only, ONLY reason I didn’t put a glowing five stars is because I didn’t get any headphones with it, but to be honest, I have no idea if stock iPhone 8’s come with headphones or not either, since they have to be Bluetooth or lightning.

  I was ridiculously nervous, buying this phone online, but to my excitement and relief, it works perfectly! The battery life is pretty good, nowhere near as bad as my last phone was, and the phone as a whole is in good condition. It also receives signal way more easily than my last phone, which is great, I wasn't expecting that.

  The phone was evwrything I needed it to be. It was super easy to activate and I had no issues doing so. It was a Christmas present for my 11 year old, which upgraded her from a 6S+ to an 8. The number one thing on her list. And she is EXTREMELY haopy about her ""new"" phone!!

  Noticed the screen was coming loose. Decided to open the phone to reset the screen only to find multiple screws loose inside. A total of 6 screws, different sizes, were lose inside the phone. It is missing the metal plates to protect the battery connections and screen display connections.

  This phones speaker does not work! Any incoming or outgoing calls you can’t hear anything but a bunch of scratchy noises. Can’t hear the person on either side of the phone. Do not buy any phones from this company <U+0001F92C>

  This is safer than buying off of Facebook market place, Craigslist, Offer Up and even LetGo. You don’t have to worry about the phone not working or a bad imei number or even damage to the device. Amazon offer you that extra security. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.

Completely flawless. Digi our phone service provider, was able to get it working within seconds.

  When I received the Amazon Refurbished I phone the phone would not work unless it was plugged into the charger. How can you certify that you RENEWED a cell phone and have a battery in that condition? I ended up buying a new iphone from verizon that cost $100 more and works great.
